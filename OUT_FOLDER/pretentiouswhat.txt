1647971805574090757 2023-04-17 14:34:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RambutanRed If you're missing Â§ßÊïëÈ©æ you're not gonna wanna look at the next pictures I will post soon... ü§™
1647970813235310593 2023-04-17 14:30:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FixTechStuff1 ohhh Ê©ÑÊ¶ÑËèúÔºÅ
1647969472731545600 2023-04-17 14:25:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The exciting reveal:   https://t.co/nc32ZJvPVk
1647969224684621825 2023-04-17 14:24:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's grown in SE Asia and Yunnan (in Dehong specifically, although we were in Tengchong when we tried it).  Read more here (Chinese):  https://t.co/C56JYBapu1  https://t.co/Apal7crxQU
1647969221773774852 2023-04-17 14:24:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I wonder what is the physio-chemical reaction that occurs when you rub it that changes the flavor so much?  I bit directly into it without any preparation or instruction and nearly spat it out directly - it's super sour and bitter and sucks all the moisture out of your mouth.
1647969218380599296 2023-04-17 14:24:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The secret way is to pinch it/rub it between your palms vigorously for about 5 seconds, unless it's no longer firm, but squishy instead.  You'll find the sourness is nearly gone, and it becomes sweet and gooey and delicious instead (watch out for pit tho).  @heidi_zhi won here:  https://t.co/zUhvgchNzD
1647969214505062401 2023-04-17 14:24:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Congratulations to @RambutanRed!  So yes, this is a ÁæäÂ•∂Êûú, or "sheep milk fruit" literally.  It is hard and sour and astringent, nearly impossible to eat unless you cover it with chili and salt, like a green papaya.  BUT there's also a secret method to eating it..  https://t.co/PEbLWCDm8J
1647960901197103106 2023-04-17 13:51:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @heidi_zhi ‚Äúrub before eating to make it sweeter" is correct.  And what's the name of the fruit?
1647956304445718528 2023-04-17 13:32:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @feilipu0628 nope, but it is indeed Chinese bayberry season right now...one of my favorite fruits. yum
1647955404729769985 2023-04-17 13:29:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DiddlySquat51 This is technically correct - I believe from my research that  ËÉ°È¢ìÂ≠êÁßë is the phytological parent class of plants that includes this specific fruit - any guess on the "correct" way to eat it (besides throwing it away lol)
1647954364080996354 2023-04-17 13:25:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> lol someone just commented with the right answer to both questions, and then deleted their reply before I could congratulate them...
1647952030424780800 2023-04-17 13:15:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dyerchase That was my wife's guess too, but alas, it was not to (juju) be
1647951560213934081 2023-04-17 13:14:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jeeeberts bold of you to presume it wasn't born this way
1647951271486455808 2023-04-17 13:12:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FixTechStuff1 According to wikipedia, the olive family (Oleaceae) and the family to which this particular fruit's plant belongs (Elaeagnaceae) are verryy distant cousins.  I will reveal all, once someone inevitably gets it üôÇ
1647949358493761539 2023-04-17 13:05:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SarahXiaYu that's a more reasonable guess than my first try ("is that a cherry tomato covered with mildew?")  But sadly, not correct üòú
1647948183937650689 2023-04-17 13:00:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We encountered this unusual fruit for the first time in Tengchong.  10 points if you know what it is, and another 10 points if you know the correct way to eat it.  (I did not eat it correctly on first try, leading to sad results)  https://t.co/mTXxqv1u5n
1647941204062109697 2023-04-17 12:32:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mister_K_fomo @laowai_shanghai This has always worked for me - buy the next station over and then adjust the fare once on the train. You may end up standing part of the way but oh well.
1647910107278381058 2023-04-17 10:29:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm Posting on twitter is surely a top use of the in-flight Wifi
1647774419090296832 2023-04-17 01:30:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chrislovesbball @davide_melia No, I didn't even know anyone from China Twitter was down there... :(  I later saw on here that he had a meetup with @xinjiangalex on the same day we were in Mangshi as well, exploring the cave. Bummer.
1647772863951405057 2023-04-17 01:23:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GadflyVince Uh, did you see the map I posted?   https://t.co/LVvPRbkJoD
1647643885387264001 2023-04-16 16:51:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Before continuing the 90-minute drive to Tengchong, we stopped at this little restaurant near the airport and got some ËøáÊâãÁ±≥Á∫ø which seemed to be a local variant of ËøáÊ°•Á±≥Á∫ø, both deconstructed rice noodles.   It was fantastic anyway, and kicked off a good run of excellent food.  https://t.co/fsf9O2XXc0
1647643880878403584 2023-04-16 16:51:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, it was a neat little diversion, about 30 minutes off the highway in Mangshi. We were basically the only people there.  This has been my first trip in China with my new Chinese driver's license and it's been really convenient for checking out sites like this.  https://t.co/lMlmMqznP6
1647643877472632834 2023-04-16 16:51:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The lady checking tickets told me this cave used to be a local attraction 20 years ago, though it was smaller.  The new development company bought the land, invested in drilling holes to connect adjacent caves, and made it a full-blown attraction...just before Covid struck.
1647643873077006339 2023-04-16 16:51:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It cuts down through the middle of a mountain, with natural caves connected via man-made tunnels and the whole thing lit up with the typical cave fairy lights you've probably seen before in caves in Asia. About 1.5km total, not counting side paths. Not for the claustrophobic.  https://t.co/UnAsRmkecl
1647643619514540032 2023-04-16 16:50:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The attraction itself is actually a combination of a terraced tea fields, a long glass floor bridge extending over a valley, and the Xianfo Cave.  The first two are pleasant (and the glass bridge is a little startling if you've not been on one before). But the cave is the point.  https://t.co/nqFYkNIAEP
1647643427885170688 2023-04-16 16:49:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The entrance to the Xianfo cave in Mangshi City, Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province looks like a Legend of Zelda dungeon.  https://t.co/jpxoMOGKpw
1647602792314585090 2023-04-16 14:08:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @VintageShanghai Yeah, I actually was there in October on my first visit a few years back, which is why this was especially shocking üò¨
1647544173040635904 2023-04-16 10:15:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Today iti's 170 in Mangshi, 151 in Dali, 174 in Kunming, 215 in Pu'er....  Yuck.  For most of the year (besides right now) you can expect AQI &lt;50 anywhere in Yunnan. This is a province with relatively little heavy industry and tons of hydropower.  https://t.co/DfFA4sYeTd
1647544163506982912 2023-04-16 10:15:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Giving up early on the Yunnan tour - the lousy air quality is too much of a bummer.  Lesson learned - Yunnan in March/April is no fun.  Apparently this cross-border Myanmar smoke issue has been A Thing for a few years now, and I never got the memo.  Learn from my planning error:  https://t.co/q2mKaux8AK
1647539219647303680 2023-04-16 09:55:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @healthapiguy @LHSummers @Noahpinion Wow, that Wikipedia article you linked is really solid. üëç  It provides a convenient and thorough summary of all the analysis and researchers that weighed in to state how the debt-trap diplomacy narrative in the Chinese lending context is a "myth", a "lie" or even, a "meme".  https://t.co/bjzjV2K4Fh
1647499702064283651 2023-04-16 07:18:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DrAltoClef4 I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here
1647498609909452801 2023-04-16 07:14:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @derniederbayer2 It's implied to be development aid, but not specified how in that original post.  Could be cash grants, (unlikely) low-interest loans, access to lending where no one else will give loans, a trade for access to minerals, etc.  It doesn't have to be "stuff for free" to be aid.
1647493983290167296 2023-04-16 06:55:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @derniederbayer2 And the Very Serious Economists doing the concern trolling never have a better option, only hollow platitudes.  They've enjoyed hospitals &amp; airports all their life and have no concept of how life changing they are, the degree to which terms may be imperfect and still acceptable.
1647492321192316929 2023-04-16 06:49:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @derniederbayer2 The theoretical existence of terms so rapacious that they make a hospital or airport not worth it for the country getting the infrastructure is real, sure, and there are cases to point to as well, but it's not like those cases characterize all or even most Chinese deals.
1647478438662635520 2023-04-16 05:54:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ffs  https://t.co/f5MP8AHRGe
1647478221515137027 2023-04-16 05:53:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "the people would've been better served with a lecture"  - A person who definitely understands development economics  https://t.co/xKvAydEdlF
1647399396919894017 2023-04-16 00:39:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I saw this one already  https://t.co/0VniMJoRFi
1646692347537920001 2023-04-14 01:50:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @susanmcc99 Just jade...the green semi-precious stone. The Ruili economy revolves around it.
1646687261881405440 2023-04-14 01:30:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent This brand new high rise community next to city hall in downtown Ruili is ~6000/sqm according to my online searches  https://t.co/9seUnBgOVq
1646682638802108417 2023-04-14 01:11:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Do you know how to drive that?" I call back over my shoulder, mildly concerned.   "Yes, I can drive!"  "And are you a good driver?" ...‰Ω†È™ëËΩ¶Á®≥‰∏çÁ®≥?  "Yes!"  ‚ÄúÁ®≥! ‚Äù  Good enough for me. We ride off into the Ruili evening.
1646682635044028416 2023-04-14 01:11:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just before we leave, I look back to see the boy has left his bike to instead straddle a motor scooter parked along the alley. His feet don't quite touch the ground   "Hey I'm gonna drive!" "You don't have the key" the skeptical sister retorts. "Give me the key and I'll drive!"
1646682631243984897 2023-04-14 01:11:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We head back up the alley towards the entrance. They trail behind me.   "Do you study English in school"  "Yeah, but I'm not good at it. She is better at English. You can talk to her in English."  I look at the girl. Eyes wide, she shakes her head no, vigorously.
1646682626030436352 2023-04-14 01:11:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Do you know?" I ask, "When someone answers like that, it's how you know they're definitely REALLY rich".  He squints at me, confused. But his sister is old enough to get it and laughs.  https://t.co/UPrqnSCgwb
1646682606908633088 2023-04-14 01:11:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Do you know how they got rich? From jade?"  The boy jumps in:  "One time I went into the courtyard and asked how he got a big house and the guy said "It's okay...I don't do anything, just a little bit of this and a little bit of that".  ‰∏ÄËà¨Ëà¨Âêß Ôºå‰ªÄ‰πàÈÉΩ‰∏çÂÅöÔºå ËøôÂÅö‰∏ÄÁÇπÈÇ£ÂÅö‰∏ÄÁÇπ
1646682602085179392 2023-04-14 01:11:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "What kind of people live here? Is it Ruili people, or people from other provinces?"   "Both. All kinds of rich people."  "And do they live here all year, or only sometimes?"  "They're always here"  I noted these two Mercedes have license plates from Jiangxi.  https://t.co/1sScBUf5PP
1646682575757545472 2023-04-14 01:11:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Do you who lives here in these houses?"  His sister has now caught up, and she answers my question  "Rich people"  "Do you guys live here?"  "Hah noo. We live up the hill. We play here."  https://t.co/eT63KzaiB1
1646682555444523010 2023-04-14 01:11:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He catches up as we pause to look at another house.  "Hey, we're not English", I tell him. "I'm from the USA and JY is from Canada". Do you know those countries?   He screws up his face, thinking earnestly, before recognition appears. "Ohhh yeah, I know. I learned it before".
1646682550721744896 2023-04-14 01:11:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's a young local kid playing with his sister in the alley. He looks about 9. His sister is perhaps 11.  As we scooter by, his eyes go wide and he shouts excitedly, "fuck! English people!" (ÊàëÊìç! Ëã±ÂõΩ‰∫∫!)  He hops on his bike and starts following us. His sister runs behind.  https://t.co/BRgD4ZnxV9
1646682530924621825 2023-04-14 01:11:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In Ruili, we turn off of a main street and find ourselves on a quiet alley filled with parked luxury cars.   The high walls lining the alley are broken occasionally by impressive  gateways revealing peeks of the courtyards and houses behind. We've found a Ruili villa district.  https://t.co/r24R1By3Ji
1646494244079796224 2023-04-13 12:43:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores @beijingboyce Exact same for me working at McDonald's in high school...All the waste gets tossed. If we ate it, we could get written up (logic being that if we knew we could eat it we'd make extra on purpose just before closing).
1646365340824408064 2023-04-13 04:10:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FFoonts Beijing is experiencing the tail end of a sandstorm from Inner Mongolia at the moment I believe?
1646326970047938562 2023-04-13 01:38:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have been disappointed by the poor air quality in Yunnan. It looks smoky everywhere.  Asked locals what happened to the blue skies...They said this is an April problem, created by farmers burning fields in Myanmar and the particles blown by the wind.  Looks like they're right...  https://t.co/cICegSmT2c
1645997257031053312 2023-04-12 03:48:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Or perhaps: "I like Ruili, but the thing I like best about this city is you" is a better translation.  It's a template; you can insert ANY city into the blank.
1645992523675090949 2023-04-12 03:29:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's all for now. I'll be spending the next two weeks traveling Yunnan and am looking forward to bringing more stories to Twitter.  Keep an eye out for posts from my compatriots on the road - @Jyves1994 and @justinaforever, who are also taking photos and vlogging the trip.
1645992517664649217 2023-04-12 03:29:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He says he put up the sign "to cheer people up" when everyone's spirits were low during the lockdowns.  If enough of Ruili's citizens share Xu's energy and indefatigable spirit, I'm sure they'll do just fine.  https://t.co/hXeKLku3pN
1645992504725241856 2023-04-12 03:29:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And on the blank wall next to his coffee shop, he's put up a sign using a popular online romantic phrase template: ÊàëÂñúÊ¨¢Áëû‰∏ΩÔºå Êõ¥ÂñúÊ¨¢ËøôÂ∫ßÂüéÂ∏ÇÁöÑ‰Ω†  It's awkward to turn into English, but I it's roughly: "I like Ruili, but I like you even more when we're in this city".
1645992498186313728 2023-04-12 03:29:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I want to see the world, but Ruili is my home."  He asked where we've traveled, and his expression turns wistful as we rattle off cities &amp; countries.  He shows us the inside of his collar, where is written a phrase from a popular Chinese hip-hop song:  "Where is my next trip?"
1645992495145455617 2023-04-12 03:29:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going back to Xu at his coffee shop, he's planning to leave Ruili soon, but not for economic reasons - he's getting ready to start college in the fall. He has enrolled at a college in Malaysia to study computer science.  He plans to return to Ruili after graduation though.
1645992026503262208 2023-04-12 03:27:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I told her the cop asked why we came to Ruili and I said we're tourists. I had showed him my ticket stub for the Moli Rainforest Park and he was excited to give us more recommendations for places to visit in Ruili. This made them chuckle.  (this is a true story btw)
1645992020119531520 2023-04-12 03:27:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Hey, did the government give you any trouble, coming here to stay in Ruili? They are sensitive about foreigners coming to stay in border areas you know".  I tell her we had no trouble, though we did happen to encounter police doing their rounds while checking into our hotel.
1645992001521995782 2023-04-12 03:27:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I ask about their experience during lockdown and we compare notes on the SH lockdown (which they had indeed heard about). I tell her we heard about Ruili's lockdowns and came to see how conditions here for ourselves   The Fujian jade carver suddenly asks me an odd question:
1645991992227426305 2023-04-12 03:27:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They tell me the site is a gem shopping mall that has been stalled since 2021 because of Covid, but they expect will continue construction. They're both optimistic about the recovery of Ruili's jade industry.  "Things are basically back to normal I think" the jade carver says.
1645991981452267520 2023-04-12 03:27:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm curious what this site is, so we stop at a nearby convenience store to buy ice cream and join two ladies chatting in the sun, hoping they can tell us more.  One is the owner of the store, a Ruili native. Her friend is a jade carver from Fujian who has just returned to Ruili.
1645991972031832064 2023-04-12 03:27:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We find a large unfinished shopping plaza, bare steel rebar poking into the sky, ragged green construction netting flapping forlornly in the breeze, bits of wind-blown plastic and cardboard forming small dusty piles against the bases of abandoned construction equipment.  https://t.co/foplQGJQDA
1645991923734446081 2023-04-12 03:27:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Aside from Jiegao, we saw signs of recovery, especially for non-jade businesses. The city felt busy-ish, although a bit...empty?  "For Rent" signs in the windows of abandoned jade stops are still everywhere. I estimated about 1 in 3 jade-related businesses were still empty.  https://t.co/0hJgxc6WJ2
1645991875281829889 2023-04-12 03:26:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There were a few buses with tourists coming to see the border and vendors with Burmese goods. Part of the street was blocked and we saw signs for an "International Duty-free Shopping Day" next week. But most of the other shops were closed, with cars parked on the sidewalk.  https://t.co/9lpiey323C
1645991813197725696 2023-04-12 03:26:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the border zone of Jiegao, next to the land port into Myanmar, the streets that once bustled with wholesale goods vendors are still completely a ghost town, aside from the street vendors in the immediate area next to the customs building, a large gold-peaked building.  https://t.co/iHQiM87QN7
1645991790242312192 2023-04-12 03:26:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "The city used to have a lot of money" he says. "But they spent it all on Covid control. Now the city doesn't have money anymore."  It's not surprising to hear - Ruili must have been TORCHING money to maintain those long lockdowns, while its key industries had been crippled.
1645991782638051330 2023-04-12 03:26:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "We used to have a saying: you can get rich here doing anything" Èöè‰æøÂÅö‰ªÄ‰πàÈÉΩËÉΩÂèëË¥¢  "Yes", I say. "I noticed the streets are well maintained and clean, and the urban greening is very nice. I guess the city collects a lot of taxes from the jade industry, is that right?"  https://t.co/z6dAqhsub5
1645991771963535360 2023-04-12 03:26:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He told us Ruili is a city much wealthier than what its size would indicate, thanks to the jade trade.  "We're just a small city, but you can even see some Lamborghinis &amp; other luxury cars on the streets here...those are the people that got rich from jade. They have big villas."
1645991758151688192 2023-04-12 03:26:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the second day of visiting his shop, he sits down with us to chat over a freshly brewed pot of his hand-poured Yunnan light roast.  He speech conveys an oddly contrasting combo of sincerity and guilelessness, mixed with beyond-his-years worldliness. He smiles easily but shyly.
1645991744855773184 2023-04-12 03:26:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He also has a number of freckles splayed across his face, some natural and some seemingly drawn on (I think). The day we visited, he had stickers on his cheeks. One was a plus sign, the other was a star.   Baggy black pants and scuffed Nikes complete the ensemble.
1645991737326981120 2023-04-12 03:26:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Xu makes quite the visual impression - he's of the Lisu ethnicity (ÂÇàÂÉ≥Êóè) a Tibeto-Burman ethnic minority found in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Myanmar. There are about 900k Lisu in China.  He has a dyed red-blonde streak in his bangs and wears a white button-up with a Prada bolo tie.  https://t.co/X6MUeNHydr
1645991698311565312 2023-04-12 03:26:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "But it was ok for our shop...we could still open and do business via delivery...because I live here. We got a lot of orders during lockdowns...actually it was busier then than it is now."  [Shanghai's failure to ensure food deliveries during lockdown remains unique]
1645991691986567168 2023-04-12 03:26:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Xu is a local, of course. He runs this coffee shop he opened last year with a friend. He lives behind the shop with his parents. He is 19.  "It was hard during the lockdowns...we ate much less variety of food. I ate so much rice and potatoes during that time."
1645991685401481217 2023-04-12 03:26:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Basically, if you weren't from Ruili, you would just leave" Mr. Xu tells me, as he carefully coaxes my latte milk foam into the shape of a bear's head.  "If you came to Ruili to work in jade, you can go elsewhere, like Guangzhou. But the people who are from Ruili stayed."  https://t.co/CQ9lPyyjtR
1645991626198900736 2023-04-12 03:25:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Over the year-plus of seemingly endless lockdowns, hundreds of thousands of people left Ruili - perhaps as much 1/3rd of the pre-Covid population.  This was inferred by the plummeting statistics of how many people were participating in the mass PCR testing events.  Sixth Tone:  https://t.co/HcXb2PZ1Vg
1645991618594623492 2023-04-12 03:25:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The problem was the nearby border with Myanmar. Early in 2021, some positive cases sneaked across the border into Ruili and caused a super-spreader event.  As a result the Party chief was sacked and the new guy seemed determined to prove he could do better...thus the lockdowns.  https://t.co/sLnOEkSlDK
1645991610201812992 2023-04-12 03:25:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ruili had a LOT of lockdowns during Covid. Several people I talked to in Ruili told me it was 9 lockdowns. Some media reports count as high as 12...  Either way, Ruili citizens spent something like 115-140 days, on and off, confined to their homes across 2021 and 2022.
1645991599514738689 2023-04-12 03:25:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back in 2020, The Paper estimated about 70k of Ruili's (at the time) population of 260k was employed in some way in the jade trade, with an mind-boggling 40k people working as live-streaming jade salespeople alone.  But of course that changed during Covid.  https://t.co/kCZvuNX75O  https://t.co/nGMxkG4kpe
1645991589591027712 2023-04-12 03:25:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Despite its small size and remote location, Ruili is fairly well-known in China, thanks to its pillar industry (and claim to fame): jade.  Ruili is the jade capital of China. The jade comes as raw stones from Myanmar, then is polished, cut &amp; distributed via Ruili.  img: The Paper  https://t.co/7zaZjm4d0X
1645991552148451329 2023-04-12 03:25:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But first, as usual, I should introduce the city.  Ruili is a county-level city within the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan. It is in the extreme southwest of the province and prefecture, surrounded on 3 sides by Myanmar.  You really need to look at a map to grasp it:  https://t.co/YcaoiwHmeJ
1645991538063982592 2023-04-12 03:25:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Picking up the Pieces: Ruin and Renewal in Ruili  We just spent a few days in Ruili, the small border city in Yunnan, famously the "most locked-down city" in China during Covid, leading to the near-collapse of its economy.  What's going on there now? Let's take a look.üßµ  https://t.co/PpSQEM6WPc

1642848938222051330 2023-04-03 11:18:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This will be the first new nuclear site for SPIC since their plant at Haiyang (also part of the first demo sites for the AP1000s at the time).  These plants are all in Guangxi, but I suspect they'll end up contributing more to decarbonizing Guangdong, via cross-provincial trade.
1642848935013416960 2023-04-03 11:18:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And then finally there's Bailong 1, which is ALSO in Fangchenggang City (I suspect that's why we're supposed to call the other one "Hongsha" now instead of just "Fangchenggang"...to avoid confusion).  Bailong 1/2 will be CAP1000s built by SPIC, scheduled to pour concrete next yr.
1642848931808968704 2023-04-03 11:18:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If Fangchenggang Hongsha Unit 5 can pour concrete on schedule, by the end of this year, then this is another unit that we can tentatively put into the 2023 newbuild column.  Here are my other 2023 picks (Sanmen 4 is already under construction now).   https://t.co/CU4jiVnKhU
1642848928470302721 2023-04-03 11:18:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I note that the proper name of what I used to call just Fangchenggang plant is now ‚ÄúFangchenggang Hongsha‚Äù (Èò≤ÂüéÊ∏ØÁ∫¢Ê≤ô).

Possession by consumption isn't even an uncommon statute around the world.  Can't abide by that, then just go live somewhere else.

1640623863242571776 2023-03-28 07:56:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelBakening You seem to be advocating for:  A. Move to a country that you know has strict laws that you don't agree with, and then,   B. Violate those laws anyway, and then,  C. Complain that the laws exist and call anyone who critiques your bad decisions a "bootlicker"
1640622842105729029 2023-03-28 07:52:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelBakening My position is consistently: the rules are clear, the penalties are clear, and the reward for being a smart aleck is the ruination of your life as you knew it.  As a rational human, you're free to evaluate that information however you want and make your choices.
1640621228213030913 2023-03-28 07:45:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelBakening The point isn't whether it's an egregious violation or not. It's whether you have enough presence of mind to realize OTHER PEOPLE consider it to be an egregious violation and adjust your behavior accordingly.  "At least I'm not a bootlicker" you'll be singing on the plane home.
1640610001067868161 2023-03-28 07:01:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @caketaster404 I can say I would not have such a law in my own country, if I was the king there.  But my opinion about its harshness isn't relevant. Not my country, not my culture. I do my best to follow the rules of the place I've chosen. If I don't like them, I am always free to leave, right?
1640606164575719425 2023-03-28 06:46:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelBakening In this hypothetical, if jaywalking was against the law and considered an egregious violation, a deportable offense, and you did it anyway, I'd be smug as hell.  Why are you gambling with such serious stakes over something so small like saving a few seconds crossing the street?
1640564207791005696 2023-03-28 03:59:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CameronWEF What's the aspect of the "rule of law" that you think would meaningfully apply to this situation?  The law for possession by consumption is clear and the penalty for violation is also clear.  Is your objection your friend wasn't told WHICH law was violated before deportation?
1640559565283659779 2023-03-28 03:40:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent Yeah there's a lot of inconsistency in how those laws are applied across countries (and states, in the US).  And I agree with you btw - it's not personally how I'd establish drug policy if I were, like, the king of my own country. But it's not my country and I'm not king.
1640558194132135936 2023-03-28 03:35:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielOlimac If he wants to complain about lack of "rule of law", it's probably best not to do it one sentence after talking about how Chinese authorities enforced the rule of their law.  For me, this guy lost the the benefit of the doubt a long time ago. Chronic entitled whining does that.
1640556591811559424 2023-03-28 03:29:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent Some kind of possession by consumption statute I'd guess. The US does the same thing with alcohol for minors.
1640554045135032321 2023-03-28 03:18:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent but what annoys me more is the sheer cojones/cognitive dissonance required to go on Twitter and whine that it's not fair and China has no rule of law...because they enforced their law
1640553565600251904 2023-03-28 03:17:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent apparently not everyone

1640552230486159369 2023-03-28 03:11:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ask me how much patience I have for expats complaining that Chinese laws apply equally to them. Go ahead, ask me.
1640551942073221121 2023-03-28 03:10:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "My friend broke the law and paid a harsh penalty for it, so there is no rule of law" is not a phrasing I would want to have to defend, personally.  But then again, I tend to believe that CN laws shouldn't have big exceptions for expats. Maybe I'm weird that way.
1640544888990355456 2023-03-28 02:42:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danmurtaugh @luzdingyu Nice report! Glad you found someone who would receive you.
1640359144388714499 2023-03-27 14:24:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim I've known more than a few chucklefucks here who could have unironically made this shitty meme. It's definitely a type of China Guy.
1640242898108317696 2023-03-27 06:42:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So while nuclear power in China may continue to face some long-term growth challenges related to siting, water usage, scaling, etc., one thing I DON'T think it has to worry about is profitability, which is surely nice to hear for its fans.  - End
1640242892836052992 2023-03-27 06:42:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also, as China's power market continues to mature and grow in sophistication, the plant will probably have other revenue channels as well.  My rough calculation above didn't include ancillary services, for instance, and there will likely be a capacity market as well.
1640242888155238400 2023-03-27 06:42:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even now at the current, lower (fixed) offtake rates, CN nuclear plants are seemingly still profitable. The offtake rates are high enough and the build costs are controlled enough. So they will be very competitive in the open market.   https://t.co/PAGwNFw3nw
1640242884959158274 2023-03-27 06:42:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course the nuclear plant will have to develop a new power sales team with market expertise, but if merchant offtake rates are up to 20% higher, they'll surely go for it.  They'll mostly have to underbid coal generators, which they can certainly afford to do.
1640242881079447553 2023-03-27 06:42:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mid/long-term power contracts in Guangxi's power exchange are allowed to settle at up to 20% higher than the coal-fired base power price, and since fuel prices are still high, power traded in the exchange is generally close to this cap rate.  That's what nuclear could get.
1640242875081588737 2023-03-27 06:42:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now keep in mind this fixed offtake rate is just temporary; by 2030 (or earlier) nuclear power plants will have to complete on a merchant basis against other generators in Guangxi, like coal.  According to market conditions, this should result in higher earned rates for power.
1640242869595439104 2023-03-27 06:42:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Assuming the plant delivers ~1000 MW to the grid, (after accounting for house load) we can make the following rough calcs:  1,000,000 kW * 7616 hours/annum (2022 average) * 0.4063 CNY/kWh  = 3,094,380,800 CNY (or ~450M USD) annual gross revenue from power sales.
1640242864469983233 2023-03-27 06:42:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fangchenggang Unit 3 (and 4) were approved for a temporary on-grid tariff of 0.4063 CNY/kWh (5.92 cents USD).  This is lower than the current coal-fired base rate in Guangxi (0.4207).  The power will offtake to the Guangxi grid and be sold to Guangxi grid's power customers.  https://t.co/4odiH3VOe2
1640242859994669056 2023-03-27 06:42:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the time, it was usual for nuclear power plants to be approved to earn the base on-grid tariff for coal in that province, whatever that may be.  Only a few special cases got higher offtake rates. And in recent years, it's been more common to see nuclear get lower fixed rates.
1640242852260368385 2023-03-27 06:42:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This first-of-a-kind plant (for CGN) took unusually long to build by CN standards - 84 months from FCD to grid connect:  FCD - December 2015 Grid connect - December 2022 Commercial operation - March 2023  When this plant began construction, the market was much more regulated.

(Although Shenzhen malls also do their fair share of trying to cool off the city with the AC blasting and the doors wide open).
1638848202572197890 2023-03-23 10:20:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg I was surprised too. I'm thinking it must be 500M rural residential power customers with very low power usage dragging the average down. I think urbanites are using a lot more.  That 2019 data was a little stale - it's up to 878 kWh/annum as of last year.  https://t.co/9mRM6yjFgx

Because it's my thread, and my content, and I wanted to talk about what a coal plant in China looks like. I work in the power sector, not a climatologist. Don't like it, keep scrolling!
1638757863438049280 2023-03-23 04:21:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "How do you keep getting to tour these facilities?"  One of the things we do at @LantauGroup  is help big companies negotiate to buy electricity in China. So we bring our clients to visit a potential power vendor and are received nicely, like target customers.
1638757858237112320 2023-03-23 04:21:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You can also see in the picture an open area on the left side of the plant- CHN Energy is hoping to build 2 more ultra-supercritical units there before Guangdong bans new coal entirely.  They have submitted their application already but it's not been approved.
1638757850741899264 2023-03-23 04:21:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "That's not fog...it must be pollution from the plant"  Here's the plant operating on a clearer, not-overcast day. It's built against a mountain that traps fog/water vapor from foggy mornings and shrouds the right side of the plant all day long.  https://t.co/S6yrkOyypG
1638757843783528450 2023-03-23 04:21:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "The smokestacks are putting out mostly water vapor"  True, but also not the whole story, since the older units especially don't have have scrubbers and aren't held to the same NOx and SO2 emissions standards of the newer plants. So there's Bad Stuff in there too.
1638757839052349442 2023-03-23 04:21:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And finally, he also mentioned that there was a geopolitical aspect to it as well, maintaining some level of healthy trade with other countries to buy coal and keep imports up. I imagine this applies more to South Africa and Indonesia, but I didn't press the question.
1638757833784311808 2023-03-23 04:21:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course they are more than capable of supplying themselves from their own mines, but sometimes domestic transport capacity is maxed out and they like to have the flexibility.  They also have some long-term contracts that are legacy arrangements that can't be easily broken.
1638757829099294721 2023-03-23 04:21:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Where does Taishan plant import its coal from/why do they import coal at all?  Only a few plants in CN import coal but Taishan is one.  Plant manager said they get some imports from South Africa, Indonesia, Australia (these days) and even the USA sometimes if it's cheap enough.
1638757820006039552 2023-03-23 04:21:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So if Beijing says "we're going to decarbonize over a period of decades and stop using coal and use renewables and nuclear instead" it's not a threat or a concern, just a thing to say "alright" and adjust to.  Not EVERYONE of course, but that's the most general/common sentiment.
1638757814616363010 2023-03-23 04:21:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> SOE employees have no reason to believe they'd be out of a job as the industry shifts to other power generation types - they have useful skills and they'll be taken care of.  SOEs function to serve the needs of the country and the people - the employees firmly believe this.
1638757806278049792 2023-03-23 04:21:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> General surprise about this quote:  I've said before and I'll say it again: The culture war among different generation types so common in the West really doesn't exist strongly/at all in CN.

1638757800456355841 2023-03-23 04:21:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Are they using scrubbers or other particulate filters?"  The two new ultra-supercritical units have de-SOx and de-NOx tech, as well as dust collection, in alignment with stricter Chinese requirements since 2015. The older Unit 1 is experimenting with limestone wet scrubbing now.
1638757794894721025 2023-03-23 04:21:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Why is the plant's coal consumption/kWh of output so low/how is this possible?"  The plant avg. needs to hit 300 g/kWh and new supercritical units need to be &lt;275 g/kWh. See more about Chinese research and application in this area here:   https://t.co/VL5cSJFz3A
1638757789119172608 2023-03-23 04:21:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If we focus on JUST households, the disparity is even more extreme.  Chinese households on per capita basis use around ~1/6th the power of the average US household (and 1/9th the average Alabama household).  So this plant can power a LOT more Chinese households than 5M.  https://t.co/QXMfaiuYLd

1638547790124167168 2023-03-22 14:26:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TaylorOgan @Xiaomi @leijun @XiaomiUSA @WilliamLuXiaomi That's a wrap on Episode 5 of David the Xiaomi Shill.  You seeing this Xiaomi social media manager? Where's my free unit?  Previous episodes here:  https://t.co/6AspA87Gze
1638465465067659264 2023-03-22 08:59:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc Isn't that a luxury handbag brand? Satchi.
1638272220584869888 2023-03-21 20:11:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally, we arrive back at the parking lot and leave the plant to go out for lunch - the conclusion to an interesting and educational morning.   It's late now, but I'll post some more comments tomorrow. Hope you enjoyed the tour...and thanks if you read this far.  https://t.co/se63pvIabs
1638272216193470465 2023-03-21 20:11:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We also pass their ocean walk, solar carpark, annd various green spaces. It's too bad about the rain -the coal plant would be a lovely place to hang out for a picnic. Everything is impeccably clean.  The facilities are spread out...we see most people getting around on bicycles.  https://t.co/yRR6h8ozP9
1638272211600674817 2023-03-21 20:11:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The rest of the site tour covers CHN's extensive  campus, with parks, entertainment &amp; sport facilities, dormitories, etc.  Most staff live here during the week and go home on weekends.   Everything is quite green and lush and tropical, as you'd expect for this part of China.  https://t.co/ZtJN3Qj2lW
1638272204487135232 2023-03-21 20:11:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The bucket cranes are operating continuously while we stand on the dock, metallic mouths inhaling massive mouthfuls of coal from the barge and spitting them back out onto the overhead conveyor belt that leads back to the plant.  https://t.co/8AVbzXYrKk
1638272200313831424 2023-03-21 20:11:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the dock, we have a panoramic view looking back at the whole plant. 5 older units on the left, the 2 new units in the middle.  The white dome on the right was built to conceal the coal pile so it will look nicer (that's exactly the reason that was given).  https://t.co/yhyvgUCYod
1638272195528105984 2023-03-21 20:11:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Approaching the dock, we can see six red cranes that are used to unload coal from the ships that arrive in the plant's dock. Up close, they're huge.  There's no rail line to here, so all of the plant's coal arrives by ship - domestic and imported both.  https://t.co/CNFDyI7nEu
1638272171754799105 2023-03-21 20:11:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On our way to the loading dock, I catch a glimpse of another ground-mounted solar facility outside the vehicle windows.  I can't imagine it produces that much. Guangdong is frequently overcast, and there's bound to be a lot of smoke in the air too. But they're trying...  https://t.co/fqeH93giyl
1638272167090733056 2023-03-21 20:11:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Exiting the elevator, I find myself looking up at the the #6 &amp; 7 smokestack, doing its thing.  https://t.co/Ru5QXxOLm9
1638272161038368768 2023-03-21 20:11:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We exit the control room via a crosswalk and pass under a series of pipes connected to the coal pulverization system. It's quite loud in this section of the plant.  We're on the 3rd floor, and there's an elevator that goes up to the 21st floor, but we head down to the ground.  https://t.co/JgXEfM1nR8
1638272143367757824 2023-03-21 20:11:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Outside the control room are several fish small tanks.  "They are here to help relieve tension" an engineer tells me, laughing.  Maybe that's why the atmosphere is so relaxed.  https://t.co/o2lE96LXiC
1638272138351353856 2023-03-21 20:11:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We spend about an hour in Q&amp;A before heading to our site tour. Our first destination is the control room for the new Units 6 &amp; 7.  Everything is totally digitized - a contrast from what I've seen before in nuclear plants. Lights blink and there are a few beeps but it's relaxed.  https://t.co/sRXDm7pIeA
1638272133808918528 2023-03-21 20:11:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I ask if he is worried about renewables building in Guangdong, dragging down the power market prices.  His response is nice:  "What's the problem with that? This is the direction of our country, to decarbonize. We should support to achieve that goal, even if it hurts."
1638272130185048064 2023-03-21 20:11:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We ask the plant manager he if knows why Guangdong has recently approved so much coal capacity.  He says 3 reasons:  1. Gas is scarce and too expensive 2. Hydropower's potential for shortage due to droughts is concerning 3. Imported power from other provinces is expensive
1638272125906853888 2023-03-21 20:11:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This facility imports about 20% of its coal from overseas and buys the rest from its own coal mines (remember CHN was formed via a merger involving Shenhua Group).  Having its own mines has allowed CHN to stay profitable over the last two years of severe coal price volatility.
1638272122169733120 2023-03-21 20:11:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They introduce their achievements in coal efficiency, a point of pride.  Units 1-2 average 317 g/kWh, while Units 3-5 average 315 g/kWh and the new ultra-supercritical plants hit 284 g/kWh.  Unit 2 is currently getting refurbished to improve efficiency - it will cost 500M CNY.
1638272116457095168 2023-03-21 20:11:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides thermal plants, CHN also owns considerable wind/solar assets.  I can see rooftop solar outside the conference room window. They tell me there's more elsewhere onsite, and on all the carpark roofs.  An engineer lends me his pen so I can take notes. It's from Trina Solar.  https://t.co/jKgBzXz8Ml
1638272111537160192 2023-03-21 20:11:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As is normal for SOEs, they introduce their staff breakdown.  The education requirements for coal employees is a contrast to what I saw before in nuke plants, which are usually filled PhDs &amp; MAs.  Here, only 4.5% had a Master's or above, and the avg. employee age is just 38
1638272107309322240 2023-03-21 20:11:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From inside a meeting room, the plant manager and some engineers introduce CHN and the facility to us.  CHN is one of the largest generators in Guangdong. They are #85 on the Fortune 500 list.   At the moment, Taishan is one of the largest thermal power plants in the world (9th).  https://t.co/cCg8kxjhDU
1638272102884343808 2023-03-21 20:11:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But frankly the air here smells and tastes...normal?  Although my pictures of the plant make it look like it's drenching the area in smoke, It was actually an overcast day with a drizzle. You can see from the pictures I took at my hotel earlier that it's more foggy today...  https://t.co/2NkOeIgSnu
1638272097494630400 2023-03-21 20:11:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I notice that the air doesn't smell bad or ashy like I might have expected, as we're walking inside under a smokestack.  Honestly a winter day in North China is much worse than this, when the pollution often used to (and occasionally still does) get so bad you can *taste* it.  https://t.co/qllFL9DJNv
1638272072018432000 2023-03-21 20:11:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When entering the main building, you are greeted by a real-time digital output of the power output across the 7 units, a neat display for visitors.  Units 2 and 5 are currently down for refurbishment but the rest of the plant is functioning normally.  https://t.co/sdGrYvIb8P
1638272068092592128 2023-03-21 20:11:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This facility, like many Chinese power generating assets, is a multi-unit plant (7 units total).  There are 5x600 MW older subcritical units and 2x1000 MW new ultra-supercritical units.  702 people work at this plant. In the US, it would power about 5M homes (~9M in China).
1638272064489660417 2023-03-21 20:11:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The Taishan power plant is owned and operated by the state-owned CHN Energy, the world's largest power company.  Yes really, the largest.  CHN Energy was created in 2017 by the merger of Shenhua Group (a coal miner) and China Guodian (a top 5 Chinese power generator).
1638272060559613953 2023-03-21 20:11:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The scene: Taishan is a typical small southern CN city, administratively part of Jiangmen.  It is famous for its clay pot eel rice, being the hometown of many overseas Chinese, and serving as the filming location of the recent hit show ÁãÇÈ£ô, which has caused tourism to boom...  https://t.co/GarVzmvOVM
1638272056197513217 2023-03-21 20:11:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What does a modern Chinese coal plant look like? I'd never been to one before and was curious. So I had to take a trip...  Say hello to the Taishan Power Generation Facility, a 5000 MW coal-fired behemoth in Guangdong.  Here's what I found out on my visit. A threadüßµ  https://t.co/iE4heD6AYd
1638215367146491905 2023-03-21 16:25:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "According to the study, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (which is funded by the US government and military-industrial contractors) the strategy has produced the opposite of what China has sought by driving countries closer to the US."
1638180641866145794 2023-03-21 14:07:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 probably?
1638177433655590915 2023-03-21 13:55:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SamKimball14 @gonglei89 yup
1637676337753370625 2023-03-20 04:44:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Vinncent @lmfsilva Specifically OP quoted the author's description of what western media have said in the past and it seemingly wasn't actually the author's point...but rather like he was sightly rolling his eyes at this past behavior (I missed this on my first reading too).
1637648080752492544 2023-03-20 02:51:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @gonglei89 In this way it's more threatening to your relationship with your most creative friend, who you used to enjoy brainstorming sessions with and now has been replaced. ;)
1637460574614487040 2023-03-19 14:26:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @philiptangatue I don't see why not.  If the ultimate goal is a more well-informed audience, one better-equipped to ultimately make their own critical assessments, then this shouldn't be controversial at all.
1637458699152396290 2023-03-19 14:19:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> btw if you have some thoughts about this and you're not comfortable engaging publicly (e.g. for professional reasons, or because you don't want to risk a Twitter mob reaction, etc.) feel free to DM instead
1637456861824958464 2023-03-19 14:11:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LukeBro92 Agreed - I'm happy to apply this policy to NGOs too
1637456330519879681 2023-03-19 14:09:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And surely if you can find space in your byline to note for the 9000th time that People's Daily is a "mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party"... ...then you can mention the salient point these scions of strategic thought rely on bomb manufacturers for their paychecks.
1637452410888286208 2023-03-19 13:54:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "According to a new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which is funded substantially by foreign governments and military industrial corporations..."  Why is this NOT a proper and appropriate way to frame scholarship from think tanks?
1637450816700424194 2023-03-19 13:47:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How is it possible there are still people thinking it's not relevant or necessary to mention which think tanks are funded by which foreign governments or weapons manufacturers?  This needs to be in the first sentence of any coverage or commentary on their reports or whitepapers.

1637052541220577281 2023-03-18 11:25:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe Is that Jinshan? That's what Jinshan seaside looked like when we were there
1636408129570357253 2023-03-16 16:44:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe @wfs8000 I like how the guy not in China tried to flex on the guy in China...by asking him if he's ever been through the process of getting a visa to go to China.
1636305014993076224 2023-03-16 09:54:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The EU obv. isn't my area of expertise, but even I have even fingers and toes to calculate that replacing imported [likely Chinese] tech with locally-produced tech is going to cost SOMEONE more.  Seems to me you'd be better served long-run by just acknowledging that up front?
1636305012623306752 2023-03-16 09:54:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...but elsewhere in the article, also has this quote:  ‚ÄúAn important element is to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt end up being some kind of green protectionism and that we do not make the green transition more expensive both for private companies and for taxpayers.‚Äù  Err...
1636305008760176643 2023-03-16 09:54:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay so the funny thing that stuck out to me about this story is that the article text includes this line:  "Brussels intends to reverse this trend by intervening in the market with the goal of increasing EU production of green technologies to 40 per cent by 2030."
1636221616496726017 2023-03-16 04:23:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 The two of you are clearly in cahoots to misuse the word "fun"
1636203045544689664 2023-03-16 03:09:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LukeBro92 Neither of them üôÑ  China's RE buildout was planned out before the war and it's weird framing to juxtapose them together.  And Shandong's issues with rooftop solar causing a glut in the middle of the day isn't some deal-breaking flaw, just a phenomenon that has to adjusted to.
1635953792863850497 2023-03-15 10:39:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lucaxyzz I use the @BotSentinel plugin to help me detect accounts that are trolly/spam or show automated behavior.
1635935630231478273 2023-03-15 09:27:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course, the potential woes of rooftop solar in eastern China are not the same as the installations of solar in those RE Super Bases out west.  To be precise, this is a *rooftop solar* hangover I think we're headed for.   https://t.co/x9EdWOnZ2B
1635933697059999744 2023-03-15 09:19:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @solar_chase That's totally right - I should have specified "the year of the rooftop solar hangover"
1635933459708518400 2023-03-15 09:18:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Furthermore, the 2023 Shandong retail ToU changes on a seasonal basis. Spring and Autumn have the biggest delta between trough and peak (~5x difference).  In the Summer and Winter, it's less severe (closer to ~4x).  Compare below to the 2022 ToU curve (at most 2.5x)  https://t.co/8r4mfcizXg
1635933455291920387 2023-03-15 09:18:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A clarification I'm realizing wasn't clear from my statement above:   Actually Shandong already had ToU retail pricing before!  What this recent revision did was make the peak-trough gap much more extreme.   https://t.co/BkxbWX0N2a
1635917001024757760 2023-03-15 08:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dewit_andrew Yes, but capacity factor was understood when the developer chooses to deploy capital in a place with weaker irradiance. They built their revenue model based on an expectation of 1150-1300 hours p/a.  Their challenge now is not how many kWh get dispatched, but the rate per kWh.
1635914065741754369 2023-03-15 08:01:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Yeah that's fair - Now I'm wondering how Shandong solar developers themselves allocate "blame" for the current situation - or if/how they think it'll get better.  Or if they'll just say "okay, well Shandong stinks now, we're just going to concentrate on Henan instead".
1635910904478068737 2023-03-15 07:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta We'll soon see how vulnerable Shandong's neighbors might be to the same issues, especially the ones pushing spot markets themselves.   Sadly we don't have a marginal dispatch model for any of them (we're working on a Shandong model now) so it's all napkin math...
1635906161085153280 2023-03-15 07:29:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @glogeex Huge expansion of pumped storage right now too, but not sure that it has any advantage over the batteries (and will take a few years to finish too).
1635905562876723203 2023-03-15 07:27:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rumbahayi How's HK looking? I think you can save still by flying HK and crossing into SZ.
1635905069102268419 2023-03-15 07:25:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DoucheBahn Seems like no...   https://t.co/XNCY9k1k56
1635903212111949824 2023-03-15 07:18:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An anti-nuclear person cherry-picking China info to argue FOR renewables, countered by a pro-nuclear person cherry-picking China info to argue AGAINST renewables.  üíÄüíÄüíÄ  https://t.co/pjb2PPyhb8
1635889864016297984 2023-03-15 06:25:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the one hand, this is effective feedback to cool overbuilding and avoid curtailment.  On the other hand, it clashes with the provinces' goals to increase renewable consumption and the target to peak coal consumption in 2025.
1635889859582922755 2023-03-15 06:25:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Rooftop solar may still be going gangbusters in Hebei, Jiangsu, or Zhejiang in 2023, but their hangovers are bound to be coming too - maybe even before the end of the year.  So I have a feeling the 2023 rooftop solar installs will miss projections *unless something changes*.
1635889856323919873 2023-03-15 06:25:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Aside from the solar developers that can find customers who want to enter into fixed-price long-term PPAs, (e.g. an industrial player with ESG commitments) 2023 is going to be a year of thin margins and greater developer hesitancy in Shandong.
1635889852700065792 2023-03-15 06:25:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Batteries aren't much of a help either - even with the huge gap between peak and valley prices, the rate of return on the batteries still can't justify the investment, after accounting for trading fees.  Plus,  load forecasting technology is still inadequate.
1635889848656740354 2023-03-15 06:25:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the same time, if you're a developer who just wants to sell your power to the grid, (instead of the rooftop owner) the grid will only give you the spot rate for power! More pain for developers.  They are now estimating 30-40% decline in profits YoY.
1635889843963334661 2023-03-15 06:25:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Already, we've heard stories of industrial rooftop owners seeking to renegotiate their energy management contracts with their rooftop solar developer, since the daytime cost of power is now lower than it was a year or two ago, when the panels were installed.
1635889839680913408 2023-03-15 06:25:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But if you're a solar developer, it just feels like punishment. Rooftop owners are enjoying ever-cheaper daytime power and now expect you to beat those rates if you want to sell them power.  ..but the solar caused those cheap prices in the first place.
1635889836963041281 2023-03-15 06:25:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is intentional; it helps to cool developer ambitions and mitigate too-fast supply expansion, in line with Shandong's mandate to limit solar curtailment to under 5%.
1635889833481752576 2023-03-15 06:25:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But also happening...is that renewables developers are losing their cozy power offtake agreements with the grid company which guaranteed them the coal benchmark rate; instead they are forced to sell at spot market rates, which are naturally much lower.
1635889830642204673 2023-03-15 06:25:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, power is really cheap at noon! If your business allows for adjustment of production processes to shift load to that time of the day, the savings can be significant.  Potentially good news for power customers.
1635889827450109952 2023-03-15 06:25:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In response to this oversupply, Shandong established a Time-of-Use retail power price curve with a 5x difference between noontime power prices (the "deep valley") and the evening peak at 7pm (the "sharp peak").

1634429094506160128 2023-03-11 05:40:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @realsteelmuslim My college roommate's mother ran away to another province for 5 months to live on a riverboat and have him before going home to pay a fine (he has an older sister).  Feels like the model of being strict on prevention and mild on ex post facto repercussions was pretty widespread?
1634419292480630790 2023-03-11 05:01:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ColdWarDefector @realsteelmuslim National Bureau of Statistics still reporting a significant gender imbalance, and that's built up from 2020 census data, *not* birth rates.  Sure there's a margin of error, but they're reporting ~35M more men than women nationwide.   https://t.co/qQ0qyaXi5F
1634416237102116864 2023-03-11 04:49:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @realsteelmuslim Yeah, makes sense. Raw birth rates would not cover:  - People who were born ÈªëÊà∑ but registered later (especially since 2015) - People who are still ÈªëÊà∑  Accounting for them would mitigate the disparity somewhat, but it's surely still quite out of balance.
1634411535492878338 2023-03-11 04:30:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim A decade ago this was already a hot topic with no clear solution, and I'm not sure I've seen any really compelling analysis since then about what can be done to mitigate the social impact.  I remember scholarly speculation that it would lead to rise in gang activity in Guangdong.

I am surprised when fellows at US geopol think tanks think the same thing...but I apparently I shouldn't be.  Even my tiniest assumptions of competence are misplaced...
1633697375515717632 2023-03-09 05:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Good on him for realizing that he wasn't going to "download" the capability to accurately do cross-cultural assessments of competence or intelligence after one whole morning of exposure (ü§™) ...and that it would be better to just check with you.  A rare trait, honestly.
1633672419163656193 2023-03-09 03:33:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Like it's one thing to be bad at your job; it's another thing entirely to go on the public record and admit it. Imagine how low the standard for competency is, that you don't have to fear professional repercussions for admitting something like this. Zero accountability.

1632918889213628416 2023-03-07 01:39:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MycleSchneider That's been known for a while. They didn't have enough under-construction plants in the pipeline in 2021 to hit the goal for operational reactors in 2025.  But they may seek to adjust the nature of the goal to count "Operational + Under Construction" reactors instead.
1632917798375809025 2023-03-07 01:35:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CSKupr 1. Loose coal has been banned in Beijing in 2017. 2. What exactly do you think is powering the small factories of Hebei? Smiles and hugs?  If you're gonna come on here and claim stupid shit, you need to make sure you don't do it to a person who works in the Chinese power sector.
1632806770405183489 2023-03-06 18:14:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ddjiii2 It'll see more play in Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning I'd figure. Maybe northern Jiangsu a bit.
1632783054715625473 2023-03-06 16:39:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JeremyWRoss It'll be one delivery for the winter and one delivery for the other three seasons :)
1632773634661158913 2023-03-06 16:02:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CSKupr Actually, if you've ever enjoyed Beijing's air (which Chinese leaders have to breathe, the same as everyone else) you'd understand perfectly the motivation for managing their carbon emissions.
1632773013212135424 2023-03-06 15:59:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I honestly haven't heard anything about dry cooling in the Chinese nuclear industry. I've got to imagine it's being studied somewhere, especially after the droughts last year...
1632772302860587009 2023-03-06 15:57:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MycleSchneider Ugh, sorry, it's my bad translation. Should have been more like:  "Yang's report points out that inland (non-coastal) plants account for 64% of operating reactors incl. many in countries like the USA, France, Russia, etc. as well as 44% of under-construction plants worldwide."
1632730235459481600 2023-03-06 13:09:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting map.  We've always had heating oil delivered at the start of the winter in Maine and I had no idea it was so rare nationally.
1632653861172420608 2023-03-06 08:06:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So that's it.  As soon as the Two Meetings are wrapped, I expect a flurry of new plants starting construction (we haven't had any new ones so far in 2023).  Forecast we'll shortly see FCDs for:  - Sanmen 4 - Haiyang 4 - Lufeng 6  - Zhangzhou 3 maybe - San'ao 3 maybe   - End
1632653857380765696 2023-03-06 08:06:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This one isn't really much of a proposal, since it's already happening and will probably continue for plants located anywhere with local heating demand.   So nothing super aggressive or ambitious here, just good business, and a suggestion that they do more of it.
1632653851416481794 2023-03-06 08:06:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course he also highlights his own company's recent achievement at Hongyanhe NPP, which is now providing district heating up in Dalian.  Other district heating schemes are in place in Shandong (Haiyang NPP) and Zhejiang (Qinshan NPP).  https://t.co/EBBB39DXA5
1632653847062810624 2023-03-06 08:06:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The final point of Yang's report was the importance of nuclear plants incorporating designs to supply heat, either for district heating, or other applications like desalination.  He points out that nuclear district heating is already widely used in Russia, Switzerland, etc.  https://t.co/hkx0HAxHtN
1632653841786376194 2023-03-06 08:06:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The conflict between the desire to find homes for 70 new units BEFORE 2030 and the unavailability of inland sites for development until AFTER 2030 is what makes me skeptical that the industry can hit that operating + under-construction capacity target of 150GW by 2030.
1632653838032461825 2023-03-06 08:06:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From other industry people I've recently spoken to, they don't expect any movement on the inland plants for the rest of the decade....until AFTER the 15th FYP (2026-2030).  At this point, availability of appropriate coastal sites will likely have been completely exhausted.
1632653834807050245 2023-03-06 08:06:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Think of risk assessments as a function of:  likelihood of negative event * magnitude of harm  When siting a plant along a river that flows into a watershed that affects hundreds of millions (magnitude of harm), the likelihood of the negative event needs to be so tiny.
1632653831543869441 2023-03-06 08:06:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Reading between the lines, we can see an acknowledgement of the biggest barrier to inland nuclear power plant development: water risk.  Nuclear plants must be sited on bodies of water.  Almost any CN inland plant will be on a river that flows into the Yangtze or Yellow Rivers.
1632653827248910336 2023-03-06 08:06:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In his report, Yang emphasizes the efforts the industry has taken to prepare safety standards for inland power plants and reduce risk of damage to rivers and watersheds that could arise from earthquakes, droughts, or floods affecting the plant.  https://t.co/DkmImmRkLR
1632653822828097536 2023-03-06 08:06:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China has frozen development of inland nuclear since the Fukushima accident 12 years ago.  Yang's report points out that inland (non-coastal) plants account for 64% of operating reactors and 44% of under-construction plants worldwide, including in the USA, France, Russia, etc.  https://t.co/GKwuVX3Sha
1632653819703349249 2023-03-06 08:06:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think plant siting will slow things down a lot. Usable land along the coasts for new plants is already is already in short supply and you can only expand already-existing sites so much...  Which of course segues to the second main point of Yang's report: develop inland plants!
1632653816591183872 2023-03-06 08:06:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If at least 10 GW are approved to begin construction each and every year for the next 7 years straight, the operating + under construction capacity total will just barely crack 150GW.  For the record, I think this is a huge stretch, but hey, it's good to have goals.
1632653812782731264 2023-03-06 08:06:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The report goes on to say:  "In the new energy system, nuclear power is needed as a 'stable power source' that complements new energy sources and plays a fundamental supporting role."  https://t.co/wkXyzQLdaT
1632653808483594241 2023-03-06 08:06:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yang's report points out that although China's operating + under construction nuclear capacity is 81 GW, 2nd in the world, it only accounts for 2.2% of the installed base and 5% of the generated power.  His report calls for 150 GW by 2030 and 380 GW by 2050 (!)  https://t.co/wBLvMTj5bG
1632653805526581258 2023-03-06 08:06:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course, the sustainability of such a pace for newbuild over the long-run will rely on a huge buildout of domestic capacity, especially human talent (engineers and technicians to work in the plants + a corresponding rise in regulatory capacity) as well as supply chain.
1632653800468283394 2023-03-06 08:06:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yang Changli's report first emphasizes the need to accelerate new nuclear power approvals to a rate of 10 per year for the next decade, an acceleration compared to the "6-8 per year" from years past.  China actually DID approve 10 new units last year so this may be doable.  https://t.co/t4fB5lKWEO
1632653795594477568 2023-03-06 08:06:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> [First, it has been noted by others that reports submitted at the CPPCC, even from top influential delegates, should best be seen as lobbying efforts, an attempt to prod policy in a certain direction, rather than a concrete policy draft. This is the case here as well.]

1630782100831092736 2023-03-01 04:08:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To clarify: this was to re-enter the mainland via SZ. I've been in HK the last few days for work, now in SZ. Regardless of which direction you're going, the immigration facilities are all on the West Kowloon side.
1630780864702590978 2023-03-01 04:03:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nuclearkatie One of the best things abou the market I focus on is that this culture war simply doesn't exist (nukes vs. renewables).  These people arrive on my TL saying whiny anti-RE things that just don't apply to CN policy and I feel like they're speaking a foreign language to me.
1630769145150308352 2023-03-01 03:17:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YeeEhren Yep, if it doesn't have any stops in between. There are a few direct trains each day, but most stop in SZ.
1630766843127554048 2023-03-01 03:08:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Immigration was fine BTW. She didn't ask me a single question, except to remove my hat. Not even "where are you going?"   But I always felt that agents at West Kowloon were especially speedy, plus I have a Class A work permit, maybe that's helpful (?)
1630766837670764544 2023-03-01 03:08:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Although the train schedule looks pretty full, only about 1/3 of the boarding platforms are in use, so we're definitely not back to pre-covid cross-boundary passenger flow yet.   Seems only destinations are SZ and GZ for now (Xiamen and eastern Guangdong used to have trains).  https://t.co/HBfCKyjJAc
1630766759895785472 2023-03-01 03:07:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back in West Kowloon HSR station for the first time in 3+ years.  This used to be a daily occurrence, as I commuted each morning from Shenzhen.  From the West Kowloon to Futian train station in downtown Shenzhen is 14 min. To SZ North is 18 min. GZ South is 46 min.  https://t.co/AhvW6c8MBd

1628956555579367424 2023-02-24 03:14:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 It's a catch-22 situation if you're an audience member. To get to the knowledge level where you're able to differentiate who is credible vs. full of hot air, you have to already reach a very high level yourself.  Which you'll never reach if you choose the wrong people to follow.
1628955810234777600 2023-02-24 03:11:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 I don't think many audience members are out there intentionally pursuing emotional fantasies - they believe they've already found China interlocutors to follow who DO "understand reality". They lack the  knowledge to differentiate credible and non-credible expertise.

1628748383472218112 2023-02-23 13:27:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JohnyKe_93 In places with a spot market, we can already see it (e.g. Shandong, Shanxi).  In Shandong, the developer estimated that if the portion they sell to the grid offtakes at the current spot rate instead of the base coal rate, they'll see a 20-30% cut to revenue.

1628677395086704641 2023-02-23 08:45:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hope you enjoyed this tour through CN dispatch hours and generation data.   Generation data is pretty much always more actionable and strategic than capacity data, especially in CN, for coal or solar alike.  I'm sure I'll be linking to this thread a lot in 2023!  -End
1628677391035031553 2023-02-23 08:45:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Capacity factor of solar being so low is why it's always good context to include actual solar generation, instead of just capacity, when examining new solar data from a certain country or region, as @solar_chase points out here:   https://t.co/MO0VHQK7Vq
1628677387125952512 2023-02-23 08:45:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And that 1337 even represented a nice little boost YoY, thanks to the capacity within the Whole-County Solar Rooftop programs having guaranteed dispatch. Curtailment was miniscule last year - especially in contrast to the worst year of solar curtailment back in 2016.
1628677383392989185 2023-02-23 08:45:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So although China has plenty of solar regions capable of generating 1600, 1700, or 1900+ hours annually, the average was still a much more modest 1337 hours last year, a trend that is likely to continue, based on where most of the panels are being built.   https://t.co/GakXa1aRkn
1628677378502430720 2023-02-23 08:45:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think this is the result of two conflicting forces: 1) Technology is improving and able to generate for more hours annually, but 2) The panels are increasingly installed in provinces with weaker solar irradiance, due to rooftop solar programs.   https://t.co/GakXa1aRkn
1628677374228467712 2023-02-23 08:45:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And finally we arrive at solar, the lowliest of the low, with an average annual capacity factor of just 15%  1337 hours annually is pretty lousy (not very 1337 at all, yuk yuk). And you can see that the trend has been pretty flat over the last decade.
1628677370742808577 2023-02-23 08:45:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd expect to see avg. annual wind dispatch hours climb steadily in the future, as offshore wind makes up a higher % of new capacity additions and begins pulling the average up.  The newbuild wind in the NW and NE is paired with UHV lines and shouldn't see much curtailment.
1628677365982466048 2023-02-23 08:45:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The "dark years" for wind are also clearly visible: 2015-2017, when wind curtailment rates in provinces like Qinghai and Gansu were very high and a lot of generation was wasted.  Curtailment is greatly reduced now, thanks to a newbuild quota and more transmission infrastructure.
1628677362627006464 2023-02-23 08:45:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Wind capacity factor stayed roughly the same YoY, around 25%. You can see 2021 and 2022 were higher than in the past due to a combination of:  More offshore wind coming online, which can see CF as high as 40%.  More grid-parity projects, which have nominally guaranteed dispatch.
1628677358336237569 2023-02-23 08:45:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hydropower dispatch *should* recover this year, but hydropower is still underperforming a bit so far in 2023, leading to production cuts for aluminum smelters in Yunnan, so we'll see.  Variance in China's hydro dispatch is pretty much up to the weather.   https://t.co/yhn4KSTKna
1628677354276159488 2023-02-23 08:45:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In fact, the last time hydro performance was this poor was 2013...which also suffered from a drought in SW China - see a trend?  Honestly, 39% CF is not bad versus the worldwide average for dam hydropower, but low for China.   https://t.co/YOIGjj69YD
1628677350375428096 2023-02-23 08:45:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hydro: Wow look at that crappy performance! 39% CF.  Hydro capacity factor was decimated this year, thanks to the drought in southwest China that wiped out Sichuan hydropower production for a big chunk of late summer, during what was supposed to be the rainy season.
1628677346512498688 2023-02-23 08:45:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I strongly suspect the average coal generation hours would have been even lower in 2022 if it weren't for the surprise heat-wave and drought in July/August, driving up power demand and making a bunch of hydropower unavailable.  This is a good segue into...
1628677339910664192 2023-02-23 08:45:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the industry is already preparing for this day: the newest generation of coal plants are aggressively optimizing in anticipation of the longer periods they're going to be in spinning reserves (not dispatching power).   https://t.co/jXgQrLLCPA
1628677336446169088 2023-02-23 08:45:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To see coal dispatch hours slide more that this...we need to see new generation from solar + wind + nuclear exceed demand growth in one year.  When we hit that inflection point...coal dispatch hours will slide for real. It will arrive earlier or later in different provinces.
1628677332465778689 2023-02-23 08:45:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Coal dispatch: Coal dispatch hours slid YoY in 2022, after spiking in 2021 due to the power crunch that year, coming in at just 50% CF.  I'll be keen to see these numbers in 2023 get back to 2020 levels to confirm the downward trend truly has resumed.
1628677328107868160 2023-02-23 08:45:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And, some nuclear plants have ALSO started offering district heating, which will allow them to defend their hours against the coal-fired generators selling CHP who were previously muscling them out of the dispatch (especially up north in the winter).    https://t.co/27c8X1jlNS
1628677324219781120 2023-02-23 08:45:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The main reason is provincial grid companies find nuclear to be a good option to fill their power pool, so they snap up almost all the merchant volumes available.  So almost none it goes to the retail market except for some volumes sold via CNNC's or CGN's own retail companies.
1628677320251940865 2023-02-23 08:45:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going forward, nuclear is expected to gradually shift out of the regulated power market, where it gets guaranteed dispatch hours at a guaranteed rate, and into the merchant market, where it will compete for dispatch.  This is not likely to affect its dispatch hours much though.
1628677314761596929 2023-02-23 08:45:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most of the YoY variations for nuclear CF can be attributed to refuelling outages.  But you might notice a significant drop around 2016-2017. This is when some reactors in NE China were seeing very low CF due to priority dispatch being granted to district heating coal plants.  https://t.co/eV7MTkk2P0
1628677311452286976 2023-02-23 08:45:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unsurprisingly, nuclear led the park, as it is rarely unavailable and rarely curtailed.  Out of 8760 hours in a year, CN's nuclear plants saw an avg. 7616 hours dispatched to the grid in 2022 for a capacity factor of 87%.  Their only downtime will be maintenance and/or refueling.
1628677305970348034 2023-02-23 08:45:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2022 Chinese power dispatch data!  Let's take a deeper look at the average annual dispatch hours for different power generators in China over the last decade and see if we can spot anything interesting in the long-term trends.

1627838322625359875 2023-02-21 01:11:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg I like Shanghai food hah. But I have a sweet tooth
1627837914620235776 2023-02-21 01:09:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @justinaforever I wanted to finish it while the conversation was still fresher in my mind - I was sure I was going to forget some funny details if I slept on it lol
1627763286736535552 2023-02-20 20:13:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Shifu, we're arriving now...but I wish you good luck with your restaurant dreams. I hope to try your food someday"  "Of course! Let me add you on Wechat. When I open my restaurant. I'll call you first."  "Okay! I'll be first in line"  ...I'll keep you updated, Twitter. üòâ
1627763281984389121 2023-02-20 20:13:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Time flies. We are arriving at my destination. It's been such an engaging conversation, and we've covered so much ground...it doesn't feel right to just...leave and never find out what how his story goes...  I look for something to say...
1627763278603780096 2023-02-20 20:13:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I've had that dish in Chaoshan restaurants before..."  "No! They only think it's authentic in Chaoshan area. They make it wrong! Shaoguan Hakka style is correct!"  He launches into a lengthy description of the proper way to prepare beef offal clay pot...
1627763274451423233 2023-02-20 20:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Ok, so if you don't like Shanghai, and you don't plan to return to Shaoguan, what are you doing here? What is your plan?"  "I'm going to start a restaurant! A chain of restaurants! Authentic food from Shaoguan! Hey, have you ever had authentic beef offal clay pot?"
1627763270974308352 2023-02-20 20:13:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "In Guangdong, we know how to eat and drink. When we drink tea, we drink the good tea. We eat the freshest seafood. We drink the good baijiu. I'm telling you, I spend more money when I'm in that environment, in that mental state, in Shaoguan! In Shanghai, I save!"
1627763267568558080 2023-02-20 20:13:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm surprised. "How could your expenses be higher in Shaoguan? Isn't it a much smaller city?"  "Yes, but I have a more relaxed life there. If I'm relaxed, I have more time to go out to eat and drink. That takes money. In Shanghai, I don't spend any money. I just work".
1627763264049549313 2023-02-20 20:12:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Is that why you are making money here?" I ask. "So you can go back to Shaoguan and buy houses?"  "No I don't want to go back to Shaoguan. Actually the salary there is not bad either, compared to Shanghai. A little lower. But my expenses are so much higher there".
1627763259121229826 2023-02-20 20:12:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "And the old Shanghainese think they are so fucking awesome because they have two or three houses to collect rent...and they don't have to work. Hah! How much can you make from that rent? 20k? 30k?  You know how many houses our Guangdong entrepreneurs have? Maybe 50! Maybe 100!"
1627763254327152642 2023-02-20 20:12:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Shanghai people don't know how to struggle or endure hardships anymore. Their life is too easy. They just like to show off, but I think they are like a frog in a well!" (‰∫ïÂ∫ï‰πãËõôÔºâ
1627763250904567808 2023-02-20 20:12:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Already, you see the 'old Shanghainese' can't afford to buy their children a house in the city, they have to go buy one far away in the suburbs. The rich 'new Shanghainese' [from other provinces] buy the houses in the city center."  His rant continues...
1627763246165004288 2023-02-20 20:12:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He goes on...  "Do you know how the old Shanghai people treat the people who are not from Shanghai? So badly! But let me tell you...the 'old Shanghainese' are going to be replaced by the 'new Shanghainese' very soon."  I'm confused. "What do you mean?"
1627763242792792064 2023-02-20 20:12:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I'm sure that's not true." I say. "There are many Chaoshan restaurants and Hakka restaurants in Shanghai..."  "Bullshit, they are not authentic. Let me tell you... they're so bad. Shanghai people don't know. They like Western food. I don't like Western food. It's not for me."
1627763239416381440 2023-02-20 20:12:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Yeah I read this before. I was curious where the cuisine border is between Guangdong and Hunan. I guess it's not the province border".   "Yes, that's right! Shaoguan eats spicy. To our south doesn't eat spicy. Shanghai people wouldn't know this. They only know Guangzhou food."
1627763234580365312 2023-02-20 20:12:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I suddenly remember something.  "I read before that northern Guangdong actually also eats spicy food. So does Shaoguan eat spicy?"  "Yes!" He almost shouts, excitedly, pointing his thumb as himself. "We like to eat spicy food! You know this! You know a lot!"
1627763230688047104 2023-02-20 20:12:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back to his opinion of Shanghai.  "Let me tell you!" he says, swelling with indignation. "The food here is so terrible! It's so bad! I can't stand it"  I search my memory for anything I might know about Shaoguan cuisine. It's farr north Guangdong, right on the border with Hunan.
1627763225533239296 2023-02-20 20:12:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A 1 million RMB investment (~145k USD) bought them ten cars - they each drive one and rent out the other 8.   They've been working hard to make their money back since. They originally estimated it would take 1.5 years to break even, but covid slowed things a bit.
1627763220743360512 2023-02-20 20:12:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Liang is from Shaoguan, in north Guangdong.  Sitting in the driver's seat, I can tell he's a short guy. He has a shiny bald head and a baseball cap. He says he's a "car guy". He reminds me of my uncle.  He moved here with his buddy a few years ago to start a Didi taxi service.
1627763217090117634 2023-02-20 20:12:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our conversation got started because he asked me if I like SH. I said: "Sure...if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be here, right?".  "Not necessarily!" he said "I'm here, and I don't like it! I don't like the city. I don't like the people! I really don't like the food".  Boom.
1627763211964653568 2023-02-20 20:12:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I had a fun conversation with my cab driver today - who turned out to be a passionate foodie, traveler, and aspiring restauranteur with a LOT of opinions about Shanghai, none of them positive. üëÄ  Let me tell you the story of Mr. Liang the Didi driver.üßµ

1627688880274309120 2023-02-20 15:17:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aginnt After getting ratio'ed to hell and rekt by Twitter itself for tweeting some stupid hit about China, you decided to tweet through it...by tweeting some more stupid shit about China?  I'm simultaneously horrified &amp; fascinated by what's going on in your head right now.  https://t.co/Bxqks12zBU
1627513096452571136 2023-02-20 03:38:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mm_schira Yep absolutely. I felt my lifestyle sphere was much broader when I was on my scooter. Now that I have to choose between taxi and metro (I live 10 minute walk from the metro) I feel like my sphere has gotten much smaller...  Need to get a scooter again for sure.
1627495648223444992 2023-02-20 02:29:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZeusGrobbelaar ...and then an entire "15 minute city"  develops around the suburban university town, since there are now tens of thousands of students in the area.  Which you knew of course, but felt compelled to comment anyway, for some reason.

1627478681160663041 2023-02-20 01:22:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is part of why people end up living in neighborhood bubbles. The traffic sucks and nearby you already have everything you need.  Last night I went to dinner at Xujiahui just 6km away and it took an hour of my life on the road and I was like "why am I doing this to myself"??
1627477935090434049 2023-02-20 01:19:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The urban areas with history sprang up like this organically and the more modern areas like Pudong were developed like this intentionally because it just makes sense.  Supermarket, haircut, gym, restaurant, whatever, your life is clustered around a neighborhood within a city.
1627477232070578176 2023-02-20 01:16:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not following the debate super closely, but it seems in China the so-called "15 minute cities" are just called "cities"

1627249547734056960 2023-02-19 10:11:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Of course...  Wonder what you'd find today if you stroll into some county school and asked to see their 3rd grade biology materials...
1627248649800679425 2023-02-19 10:08:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @davidrvetter Thanks!  I get no pleasure at all out of talking down China's achievements in wind or solar, since they ARE worthy of praise, but this one unfortunately just wasn't it.
1627247987410993153 2023-02-19 10:05:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Thanks for sharing - don't have many opportunities to review 3rd grade classroom materials...  Would you think materials like this being standard for a 1st tier city 10 years ago means they're also now common in smaller cities or the countryside?
1627245805009801219 2023-02-19 09:56:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thread got broken because I deleted a tweet. It continues here:   https://t.co/9XlXf3CLs2
1627244888646623235 2023-02-19 09:53:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @davidrvetter Thanks! Glad it was useful for you.
1627244235211833350 2023-02-19 09:50:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (If you're curious, that deleted tweet in the middle of the thread was where I previously wondered how the article author could have gotten the data wrong.  When it wasn't the article author's fault at all - he had reported accurately, and Dorfman then misrepresented it).
1627241819045253120 2023-02-19 09:40:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, here are the links for the NEA and CEC data, which the author DID cite accurately, although they were misrepresented in the tweet.  NEA:  https://t.co/Gca762Xa5n  CEC:  https://t.co/0b659yK2gC
1627241815920500736 2023-02-19 09:40:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's more relevant that the wind + solar generation  displaced something else in the grid mix, like  coal.  If you wanna highlight something as a milestone here, try to quantify how much thermal generation was averted, or coal NOT consumed...much more useful IMO.
1627241812816699392 2023-02-19 09:40:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I still don't love this phrasing, because it invites flawed inferences and distorted reporting, as Dr. Dorfman demonstrated, but at least it's mathematically accurate.  But actually I'd much prefer that generation and consumption aren't compared at all...
1627241807917748226 2023-02-19 09:40:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Reading the article more closely...I see the author didn't mess up the numbers - they actually reported them accurately!  It's actually Dr. Dorfman who appears to have misrepresented them in his tweet, saying they're equal, so I must withdraw my criticism of the author!  https://t.co/VxP9jCDuBp
1627237631930273793 2023-02-19 09:24:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In reality, the power consumed by the residential sector every day, hour, minute over the year was a big messy mix of whatever the local grid company bought from generators to fill their power supply pool, differing widely by province.  Could be anything in there really.
1627237627199094785 2023-02-19 09:24:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Was there enough solar and wind every day, hour, minute, to ‚Äúpower every home‚Äù every day, hour, minute?  Of course not. We know wind + solar are variable, while load curves are much more constant.  Plus, China residential power peak load is at 7pm. When there's no solar...
1627237619137667072 2023-02-19 09:24:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But more importantly, even if it WERE mathematically correct, this would be a misuse of the data.  Annual solar + wind generation is fine for showing trends and directionality, but power is not consumed on an annual basis. It's consumed on a daily, hourly, minute basis.
1627237612133179392 2023-02-19 09:24:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, the claim is just wrong:  According to China's CEC, last year, residential power consumption was 1336.6 TWh or 15.48% of the whole economy.  And per the NEA, 2022 wind + solar generation was 1190 TWh, or 13.8% of all generation.  So no, it couldn't meet residential demand.
1627237607548792832 2023-02-19 09:24:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "China now has enough wind and solar to power every home"  That's not right on two levels - both the math, but also conceptually.  Kind of a good Brandolini's Law example - explaining why it's wrong will take way more effort than saying it.  But here goes...
1627168300127100929 2023-02-19 04:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aginnt This is false. It's obviously false. It's absurd you'd even think it's true. Delete.   Again, if it's not clear, you are lying to your followers. Not exploring a grey zone. Not looking at "alternative interpretations".  Lying.
1627134606670708736 2023-02-19 02:34:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wang_seaver You took a higher road than I could have - I doubt I could have resisted going after his character while tearing into his shallow, mediocre "analysis" on a topic he clearly has only a basic grasp of.  But then again, that's why I have no blocked...so I am never tempted.

1626231631588786180 2023-02-16 14:46:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang Sorry, not my intention. The original SCMP article spends more talking about the "why" of it, with more complexity. I agree with your assessment - it's (usually) not the comedian's fault personally.  But regardless of what's to "blame", I know for sure it's not to my taste.

These last few years must be so cool - would love to hear if you had more insights on the evolution of the scene to share.

1626090546212245504 2023-02-16 05:26:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To demonstrate, I'll post some clips of the ËÑ±Âè£ÁßÄ "talk show" stand-up comedy format has really been taking off in CN over the the past few years.

1626090542173155329 2023-02-16 05:26:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Speaking rom the perspective of a non-CN person, I find diaspora Chinese comedians distinctly unfunny compared to comedians in China.  I much more enjoy comedy about quirks and absurdisms of Chinese life where the punchline isn't just that the performer themselves is Chinese.
1625798707701743616 2023-02-15 10:06:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, the solution for me is probably that I just need to focus more on reading Chinese scholarship, which naturally won't have this "bug under microscope" framing when looking at Chinese issues.
1625797998755348480 2023-02-15 10:03:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I don't know how to write it differently though.  Maybe there's nothing wrong with the phrase itself, beyond what it  implies (to me anyway) about the content I'm about to read - that it'll be kinda "bug under microscope," written by people not in China, for people not in China.
1625797995529904128 2023-02-15 10:03:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's something about this social science Mad Libs framing trope that you frequently see in western bios and paper abstracts that kind of annoys me, but I can't quite put my finger on why:  "Conducting research into China's _______ to enhance our understanding of _______"

It's no different working here being an American than any other western nation I suppose. It's not hard to get a job if you have a skillset that is in demand. If your skillset is less specialized, then language ability is key.

1624346155063873536 2023-02-11 09:54:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For any of my Spanish-speaking followers - here is @GuillermoAbril's report for El Pa√≠s on our visit to the rooftop solar plant last weekend.  "China, un imperio de tejados solares" "China, an empire of solar rooftops"   Mr. Dong looks much more serious when he doesn't smile. üòÇ

1624327032103661570 2023-02-11 08:38:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN Lol you know about the leeks.  This was a point of conversation while we were there. They said it's hard to find the nice giant leeks in Zhangqiu now because the best ones get sold to fancy restaurants in Japan and SK, but if you know the right market you can still get them.
1624262276005122049 2023-02-11 04:21:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally, my DMs are open and I'm usually down for grabbing a coffee in SH or wherever I happen to be for work if you don't seem like a crazy person.  I'm pretty much the same person On Here as IRL, to the extent that that's possible.  That's all. Thanks for following!  -David
1624262272456744961 2023-02-11 04:21:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And so while of course I have lots of opinions about lots of things, I'll usually limit my hot China takes to things that I have specific experience with, or some unique insight into (like energy sector stuff).  It's not the strictest of rules, but I try.
1624262269424263168 2023-02-11 04:21:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm not your China whisperer. Overall, I think the world has had quite enough China Explaining from people who look like me.  When I write about rural CN development on Substack, I'll always try to put the perspectives of local people ahead of my own commentary.
1624262266161094656 2023-02-11 04:21:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm not a China Watcher; this is my home. If I wasn't happy here, I wouldn't be here (and I don't understand why anyone who is unhappy here stays).  I have no patience for low-effort troll crap in my replies.  Try it, but you'll only get to do it once, so it'd better be worth it.
1624262262545616896 2023-02-11 04:21:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides energy, I also tweet about China broadly, especially everyday life and on-the-ground experiences from traveling to small cities and rural parts of China.

1624262253473316864 2023-02-11 04:21:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I started my career in Shanghai, which I returned to last year after a few years in SZ.  So yes, I moved back just in time for SH's lockdown and all the 2022 weirdness.  But one big bright spot - I got married back in June! She thinks I spend too much time on Twitter. I agree.
1624262246686916608 2023-02-11 04:21:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I started my career in the energy sector here after I got my MA back in 2014, so I've never lived and worked as an adult anywhere but China.  I was in the nuclear sector for a few years, and then my company was acquired by my current employer @LantauGroup back in 2019.

1623931537673846784 2023-02-10 06:27:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gwbstr But is it really abbreviated "see me wee?" üëÄ
1623613974532202496 2023-02-09 09:25:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Please see a follow-up point about C&amp;I rooftops and the Shandong spot market here:   https://t.co/vZsXqVjOLo
1623613627399036928 2023-02-09 09:23:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And, it's important to note, those C&amp;I rooftop customers aren't even necessarily part of the Whole-County scheme. They chose to build themselves because it saves money.  You don't HAVE to be part of this scheme, to build rooftop solar, after all. I should give them credit too.
1623613623770963969 2023-02-09 09:23:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That means a chunk of the rooftop solar that came online last year in China will be C&amp;I rooftops *in other provinces not Shandong*.  Jiangsu and Anhui and Zhejiang and other places where C&amp;I rooftops still make financial sense, that don't have a spot market like Shandong's.
1623613619836719106 2023-02-09 09:23:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Remember, none of this matters at the moment for the projects that offtake at the grid base price, or for power buyers using grid supply. This is all spot market retail stuff.  But this leads to an inescapable conclusion: Shandong C&amp;I power customers don't build rooftop solar.
1623613615097135104 2023-02-09 09:23:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Over the mid/long-term, Shandong will need to build some great big grid storage facilities to take pressure off the system.  There are at least 4 GW of pumped storage in the development pipeline right now according to their Five Year Plan.   https://t.co/77uhm2Y1e5
1623613611531997185 2023-02-09 09:23:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One short-term outcome is that power buyers will be heavily incentivized to try to rearrange their production to take advantage of cheaper prices at noon (and soak up supply?)  We've seen this behavior before in Gansu, which also implemented a spot market.  https://t.co/HcZbx8YR8u
1623613607719370752 2023-02-09 09:23:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This implies few things:  1. If you're a generator and exposed to the spot market, batteries are in the money.  (hell, I'd just build a standalone battery station lol)  2. If you're a power buyer exposed to the spot market, you don't want rooftop solar...no financial benefit.
1623613604535881729 2023-02-09 09:23:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Starting from 2023, in 3/4 seasons,  you'll get a paltry 0.1 CNY/kWh for your power, selling into the spot market from 11am-2pm.  A few hours later, at 6-7pm, it'll be 2 CNY/kWh...a 20x difference...  And those rates translate through to the retail power rates too.
1623613601184624640 2023-02-09 09:23:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shandong has implemented the most aggressive retail Time-of-Use pricing in the whole country, starting from 2023, with corresponding time-of-offtake rates for generation.  And WOW they are extreme...
1623613597845946368 2023-02-09 09:23:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> C&amp;I rooftops actually have the WORST economic case for rooftop solar in Shandong now, because of the spot market.  State Cloud even told us - they don't want to develop C&amp;I rooftops at all...they're waiting for conditions to hopefully improve. But they're actually getting worse.
1623613594746372097 2023-02-09 09:23:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For an industrial power user, a big selling point of  installing rooftop solar is to offset high power prices.   But if your rooftop solar is generating at the same time as your retail contract is already delivering cheap power from the spot market...what's the point?
1623613591554506752 2023-02-09 09:23:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This doesn't affect power buyers who aren't exposed to the spot market...nor does it affect developers who aren't (yet) forced to sell to the spot market.  But commercial and industrial power users DO have exposure to the spot market, via their retail power contracts.
1623613588081610752 2023-02-09 09:23:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shandong is already showing signs of being the victim of its own success when it comes to rooftop solar.  What I mean is, even the relatively small volumes of solar making it onto the spot market are flooding the market and crashing daytime spot prices:   https://t.co/NWLim1RZvg
1623613582725517313 2023-02-09 09:23:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I need to expand on this point a little more, because there's an distinction to be made here about different rooftops, and a key point about spot power markets.  This won't be nearly as exciting or visual of a thread as the last one, sorry in advance. More of a Nerd Threadüßµ
1623586690945413120 2023-02-09 07:36:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant (sorry for the long rant...As you can tell, this is indeed a favorite topic of mine, having started my career in nuclear and now spending most of my day thinking about renewables and grid and power markets)
1623584672428212224 2023-02-09 07:28:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant That being said, they're 100% aware of the need for those reactors, because otherwise what the heck else is gonna provide firm backup for all that sketchy variable capacity?
1623584318428942336 2023-02-09 07:27:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant And then there's capital intensity... siting headaches.  Even for a country bullish on nuclear like China, these things mean the most they can dream to target is ~10 reactors a year...  Build at that pace for 40 years and you still are only at a fraction of what is needed.
1623583426749296642 2023-02-09 07:23:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant The maximum rate that nuclear buildout can reach is constricted by so many things, even in a supportive build environment like China. How many massive forged components can you turn out in a year, while maintaining quality? How many nuclear engineers can you graduate?
1623582708420190208 2023-02-09 07:20:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant Whether it's "nuclear supporting renewables" or "renewables supplementing nuclear" can be a point of debate, sure, but they'll both be in there, at the maximum rate each industry can respectively manage.
1623582186522972160 2023-02-09 07:18:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant They don't have enough nuclear for that though, and they won't for many years. The Chinese nuclear industry itself hopes to build 8 or 10GW of capacity every year, which are fine numbers, but not enough by themselves to replace all the coal that has to be replaced.
1623561963556179968 2023-02-09 05:58:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant For various reasons, both simple and complex, it seems that China is not looking for nuclear to take a dominant role in the energy transition, but more of a supporting one.  I discussed it a bit here:   https://t.co/q5U75HjwKV
1623559580113571842 2023-02-09 05:49:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ItMeT0ken @WomanEncircled @AdamBoyce4 @RealSexyCyborg Yes, because this on the other hand, is exceedingly fucking normal behavior  https://t.co/JW6RvTTO4l
1623558500092903426 2023-02-09 05:44:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant Actually that whole thread I QRTed above might be of interest to you - how China is approaching flexibility, and the role that coal and/or nuclear will play.  I see you follow Alex Epstein so you're probably used to seeing him rant about this stuff.
1623555709320445952 2023-02-09 05:33:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant Yes, generally. In this case, Shandong meets about 85% of its needs with local coal and, as you can see from the skies in the pictures, would very much like to change that.  Plus...China has some additional quirks to its half-liberalised power sector:   https://t.co/MF8hnWI2fM
1623550321611124736 2023-02-09 05:12:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant Yes, and Shandong is a unique case even among CN provinces. Because of the massive solar capacity going in right now, their daytime spot prices are very low...with the tariff difference between the "deep valley" at noon and "critical peak" in the early evening as high as 1:7.
1623546347348713472 2023-02-09 04:56:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant Overall, I'd say the "entire case" for the rooftop solar...neither rests on the on-grid tariff (since most offtake is sold to the rooftop owner) nor will it come "crashing down" once the offtake mechanism shifts (because it was designed with competence and intentionality).
1623545908859404291 2023-02-09 04:54:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant The spot market is still an early-stage pilot, but the price difference between peak and off-peak hours is sufficient that batteries will be in the money, time-shifting generation from midday to the early evening.  That should help reduce the pain of moving to spot offtake.
1623545152773165056 2023-02-09 04:51:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant So ~85% of their offtake is sold to the rooftop owner at a discount versus the grid tariff.  As for the portion sold to the grid - they estimate that eventually moving from base price offtake to spot market offtake will cut their revenues by around 20-30% (without batteries).
1623544532477550593 2023-02-09 04:49:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QuixoticQuant For the hospitals and schools, they rarely sell to the grid, since the hospital is always using their rooftop solar, and the school is only closed about 6-8 weeks out of the whole year (this is a Chinese school...there are even students there during weekends).

1623195010824015873 2023-02-08 05:40:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ryan_ed_pat The rooftop PV system mentioned in my thread cost 4 CNY/watt.   Would you like to guess what percentage of that 4 CNY was the cost of electricity used to produce the polysilicon?  Do some research if you want, but don't ask Shellenberger, because he definitely doesn't know.
1623175304310325249 2023-02-08 04:22:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @toni_tonirl @NeutronDancer And if you want to say something like "well what about nuclear?" then just remember China also has the largest nuclear newbuild pipeline.  I don't give a shit about the energy culture wars, and neither does CN. We build everything that works - nuclear, wind, solar etc.
1623174764520161280 2023-02-08 04:19:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @toni_tonirl @NeutronDancer If you don't live here and breathe the air, you might find it hard to understand why China is keen to develop something other than coal...
1623173063645990913 2023-02-08 04:13:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @shangwei_ From the developer's perspective - they prefer to sell power to the rooftop owner. That's pegged to the residential power rate and they can sign a long-term PPA .  If the rooftop owner doesn't want the power, then they have to sell to the grid, at a lower rate, for shorter PPA.
1623172444575117312 2023-02-08 04:10:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @shangwei_ Yeah the rural residents likely have miniscule power consumption already - given the option to take a discount on their power bill by using the rooftop power vs. earn a monthly or annual rent for the use of their rooftops, most will choose the latter.
1623171967653380096 2023-02-08 04:08:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jackhon_hk On bottom of the project site poster, you can see two logos: State Cloud and another company called ÈáëÂù§ÁßëÊäÄ.  That second company is the maintenance company hired to take care of the panels. It's probably a very local service provider...maybe owned by the mayor's brother? :)
1623155978354167808 2023-02-08 03:05:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim @CurtExplores I'm sure lots of people find them revolting  *ba dum tiss*
1623146640159932418 2023-02-08 02:28:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JohnSmi94424885 It must be so hard to understand China from the other side of the world, reading exclusively crazy propaganda like you guys do and ending up with such a wrong view. I wonder how long until you admit you were wrong. Five years? Ten?   Maybe never I'm afraid...  But good luck.
1623141527836061696 2023-02-08 02:07:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SilDogood Aesthetically the idea of building a bunch of solar and wind firmed up by nuclear in some remote part of Inner Mongolia (next to a lake, for the nuclear cooling) and brought to cities with UHV lines is very tidy and attractive. I suspect it creates many other headaches though...
1623139634812428288 2023-02-08 02:00:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SilDogood I haven't looked at the economics of those huge desert projects - they're all being developed by massive SOEs.   Obviously the rooftop solar is much more capital-friendly. If a bunch of little guys are willing to work hard as hell to make 6.5%...good for them I guess.
1623137535416492032 2023-02-08 01:51:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JohnSmi94424885 But did you learn something?

1623136459233595392 2023-02-08 01:47:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TallDave7 Shandong is still far from this - around 85% of their consumption is coal still. They have about 10 years to figure out how to firm up their grid while building RE. There's a lot of pumped hydro and nuclear in the build plan.
1623135925126725633 2023-02-08 01:45:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaowang1984 Curtailment so far is quite low overall in Shandong. The grid guarantees offtake for grid-parity projects and things have to get really bad for them to curtail it. That being said, the rate might be awful (spot market rate)
1623126995214438400 2023-02-08 01:10:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MillerforKeller The company that installed and owns the panels will allow their revenues to be cut in half by dusty panels because they forgot to hire a maintenance crew?  Yeah sure buddy.

1622994336526004225 2023-02-07 16:22:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 In the end, the local govt's role appears to be to soliciting the tender to give the whole process official legitimacy...and ensuring there are no barriers for the developer to do their work.  The rooftop owners participate because it either saves them money or makes them money.
1622993426471084039 2023-02-07 16:19:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 Well there's a target - 50% for gov't buildings, 30% for C&amp;I, 20% of residential. But there's no practical incentive or punishment for meeting or missing this target.  I think my characterization of a "mandate" in a previous thread was off the mark. It's a...suggestion?
1622979826088046593 2023-02-07 15:25:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SilDogood Which is why, recently, often you see those large-scale projects off in the deserts somewhere where resources are good and land is cheap/nearly free, paired with ultra-high voltage lines to carry the power thousands of km to whether the power demand is.
1622979516426752000 2023-02-07 15:24:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SilDogood As for places where the land is undeveloped/cheap to acquire, that's also going to be in places where there's weak power demand and the developer would get a really low rate for their power - perhaps even a lower return on investment than building on Shandong rooftops.
1622979095549337600 2023-02-07 15:22:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SilDogood In the case of Shandong specifically, yes.  Land usage rights are extremely expensive and all the land in Shandong is already farmland or otherwise developed.  The rent for rooftop space is much lower than paying land acquisition costs for ground-mounted solar.
1622975109035347970 2023-02-07 15:06:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 Yeah the commercial &amp; industrial ones could build their own or use another developer. But they might still find a better deal with the designated developer, because of scale.  As for residential rural people...they probably never thought about solar panels in their whole life üôÇ

1622965182359080967 2023-02-07 14:27:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @insipidwanker Yes Shandong has good offshore wind resources.  Shandong is building pretty much everything honestly.   Their approach to energy planning is not: "what's the 'best' energy?" and instead: "is there any good reason to 'not' build this energy?"   https://t.co/SKzbEOUeGZ
1622955208887390209 2023-02-07 13:47:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @insipidwanker That's about average for solar across China. Obviously not as good as what you'd get in Gansu or Inner Mongolia, but those places have weak power demand, while Shandong is a net importer of power. Any clean local generation is welcomed.  So ROI is actually better in Shandong atm.
1622951759676338177 2023-02-07 13:33:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Amazing haha. Thanks!
1622938912246353921 2023-02-07 12:42:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @insipidwanker These projects aren't grid connected yet. But rooftop solar in western Shandong generates about 1250 hours annually, which is about 14% capacity factor.
1622938056235061248 2023-02-07 12:39:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Marc_Compere Maybe the descriptor you're looking for is "socialism with Chinese characteristics". Not in an ironic, clich√©, or joking sense, but truly, a hybridised model adapted for China's political/economic realities and aspirations.
1622936534365401091 2023-02-07 12:33:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 Only the government buildings can assumed to participate; the private homes and businesses/factories must be negotiated on a commercial basis.  They won't opt in if it's not lucrative for them, either via access to discounted power or receiving rent for the rooftop.
1622926847704199168 2023-02-07 11:54:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta By the way, did I manage to cover all the things you were curious about?

Not every firm is driven by some romantic view of "the big picture" and strategic view on reducing import dependency, esp. not small private developers.

1622893034588491776 2023-02-07 09:40:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cchukudebelu It would wonderful to see African solar developers get practice with profitable projects in urban areas, giving them the experience &amp; capability to tackle more difficult things like rural electrification. But the policy and finance environment must be created by the government...
1622884319151923201 2023-02-07 09:05:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TxLxS Hah...Indeed in this model it's very important for the developer to have a good relationship with the the local grid company, since they are essentially serving as an "agent" for all of that BS, (thus the rooftop owner's process is more simple).

Some places also use drones.  The O&amp;M company is actually on the project poster with their logo at the bottom - they will handle cleaning.
1622860006180917248 2023-02-07 07:29:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Octogenarian_SH On the bottom of the facility poster, you will see another company logo ÈáëÂù§ÁßëÊäÄ, that's the company that will do the maintenance. This is part of long term O&amp;M expenses (OPEX).  It's likely a local company...Maybe the mayor's brother? ;)

1622857918411603968 2023-02-07 07:20:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BobsMarley5 Yep, they're everywhere! Mr. Dong said they are popular with locals because they save money vs. electric or gas water heating. Not familiar with the economics myself though - my building has gas.
1622856382738497536 2023-02-07 07:14:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @UndertakerHappy @kurt_beckett *from 13 years ago
1622841290965794816 2023-02-07 06:14:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman Perhaps - but if your revenue depends on good generation, you probably don't want to wait for the rain.
1622840626890051584 2023-02-07 06:12:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kurt_beckett These are for power generation.  You're thinking of solar hot water heaters - different technology entirely.
1622833660901875712 2023-02-07 05:44:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But it provides an real look into how these programs work- how kilowatts add up to megawatts and then gigawatts, bankers and local fixers joining hands to will them into existence, scattered across thousands of towns, a million dusty rooftops in China's industrial heartland.  https://t.co/wPRJRyDIS8
1622832823119024128 2023-02-07 05:41:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In China today, there are thousands of State Clouds, with tens of thousands of Mr. Dongs and Zhous, handling tens of thousands of villages.  Zhangqiu isn't unique- just one district in the vast expanse of Chinese cities' suburbia/countryside, spraying solar panels onto roofs.
1622832819478339589 2023-02-07 05:41:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After the site visits, we got lunch with Mr. Zhou, State Cloud's local GM.  A snappy dresser with a smart haircut, he said he was poached to State Cloud from his last job in a bank financing coal plants.  Now he has a portfolio of solar and wind in  Shandong and Henan. He is 35.
1622832815346962432 2023-02-07 05:41:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So they actually HAVE to build the profitable sites first, which will free up cashflow and keep their investors happy, which allows them to go on to build at the residential sites to meet the targets of the whole-county solar program (20% of residential rooftops).
1622832811672752131 2023-02-07 05:41:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They target an IRR of just 6.5%, lower than the threshold for most large SOEs (8%). The fierce competition among small players drives margins.  Usually foreign capital hopes for IRR of 10%+ and stays away, but they did have a foreign fund who put money into this Zhangqiu project.
1622832804404027392 2023-02-07 05:41:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The sites we toured - hospital &amp; school - Mr. Dong says they built those at a CAPEX of ~4000 CNY/kW - including all materials, equipment, labor, fees, etc.  In Q4 2022, panels were about about 55% of that - they use Trina &amp; Canadian Solar with Huawei inverters.  https://t.co/YQ6twyBdeC
1622832800729800704 2023-02-07 05:41:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In general, the residential rooftop projects don't make State Cloud any money - but they are required to submit a package tender that includes them too.  They make profit on public buildings and (sometimes) C&amp;I rooftops and try to just break even on the residential segment.
1622832795692457986 2023-02-07 05:41:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mr. Dong said that when a big SOE wins a contract to develop Whole-County Solar, they usually have to outsource it to a local company like State Cloud, because they don't have the ground game to get the project done.  Zhangqiu District has a population of 1M, with 900 villages(!)
1622832792001482752 2023-02-07 05:41:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mr. Dong is a local Shandong guy, of course, which is necessary to get these kinds of projects done.  You need to visit hundreds of towns, negotiate hundreds of contracts, with endless wining and dining and hand-shaking.  Behind that cheerful face is a savvy negotiator I'm sure.
1622832786909577216 2023-02-07 05:41:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This model will be different for commercial &amp; industrial rooftops, who pay different power tariffs.  And with residential rooftops, they rent the rooftops and sell 100% to the grid most of the time, since rural residents don't use much power anyway.
1622832781150793728 2023-02-07 05:41:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The rest of the power will be sold to the grid company via 3-5 year PPAs, according to the local distributed solar on-grid tariff policy.  Currently that's at the base coal price in Shandong. In the future, it may become the spot price, which will definitely hurt their revenues.
1622832777472385026 2023-02-07 05:40:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They don't pay rent, but need to offer the rooftop owner a power discount   For hospitals &amp; schools, they are fixed at the cheapest tier for residential power. So he will offer them ~10-20% lower than that for 20 years.  This is the key variable when they submit their tender.
1622832772460187648 2023-02-07 05:40:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For public buildings, they use the Ëá™ÂèëËá™Áî®„ÄÅ‰ΩôÁîµ‰∏äÁΩë model. State Cloud owns the panels, selling the power to the rooftop owner when the owner needs it, and otherwise selling to the grid.  So he needs to negotiate two contracts - with the rooftop owner and with the grid company.
1622832768790175745 2023-02-07 05:40:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mr. Dong told us they started with the public buildings in this district.  Zhangqiu has about 130 schools, but only ~90 of them meet the structural requirements for panels. There's also 30 hospitals, plus many gov't buildings. His job is to negotiate with the rooftop owners.
1622832762876235776 2023-02-07 05:40:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our guide for the day was Mr. Dong, a cheerful guy with a round face that has spent many hours on rooftops, whipped by the wind and tanned by the sun. He's a project manager for State Cloud.  I generally got about 60% of what he was saying thanks to his strong Shandong accent.  https://t.co/vKXveNrOBX
1622832759189434368 2023-02-07 05:40:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They won their bid to the local gov't to develop solar across the entire district, including public buildings (gov't, hospitals, schools) as well as commercial &amp; industrial buildings, and private residences.  They estimate the district's rooftops will yield ~150 MW in total.
1622832752583376896 2023-02-07 05:40:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This field trip was in Zhangqiu, a suburban administrative district of Jinan, Shandong's capital.  The company that won the tender to build the rooftop solar in this district is a small developer called State Cloud ‰∏≠‰ºÅÂõΩ‰∫ë. It's funded via a mix of private and state capital.  https://t.co/WQ6xaiL4Tt
1622832748561055746 2023-02-07 05:40:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The key policy is: Whole-County Rooftop Solar (I introduced this program in a thread last year - go check it out if you haven't read it.)  Solar developers are encouraged to build solar on all the rooftops in a single county  together as a package project.  https://t.co/CNIswS1IYd
1622832740604448768 2023-02-07 05:40:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you follow solar, you've seen China had a massive year for solar in 2022, adding around 87.4 GW. That's 2x what all of Europe added altogether.  The majority - 65%  - was rooftop solar.  That mostly came from mini 100-200 kW installations like this - or even smaller.  https://t.co/IZvBzKkgo9
1622832733054701568 2023-02-07 05:40:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Between the pollution and the dust that is kicked up from the construction everywhere, these panels will need frequent maintenance and cleaning to keep them functioning well.  The just-installed hospital roof was already covered with a thick layer of dust.  https://t.co/J6QgUol5wg
1622832727384031232 2023-02-07 05:40:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On another roof, I caught a neat juxtaposition of the panels neatly stacked and awaiting installation - against a backdrop of a local materials factory spewing smoke into the air. Shandong is a major industrial province.  https://t.co/Ty4OnxPyCN
1622832718232031233 2023-02-07 05:40:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So although was the weekend - and the Lantern Festival, - a team of six guys was out there working on a lower level, installing concrete blocks and supports on the cafeteria roof.  One saw me taking pictures and gave me an energetic thumbs up, but I missed the moment.  https://t.co/k3tibWvWpB
1622832712674578433 2023-02-07 05:40:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next door, the local high school is still halfway through installing its 223 kW solar farm.  This one is slower to build, because workers can't work during school hours and disturb the students.  https://t.co/qIytJsiHHb
1622832706907414529 2023-02-07 05:40:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The picture in my first tweet is on the rooftop of a hospital in Zhanqqiu district. This installation is already completed and will soon connect its 145 kW (across three rooftop sections) to the grid, pending the gridco's final inspection.  https://t.co/LOiBTaOnIq
1622832701131874306 2023-02-07 05:40:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How is China building SO MUCH rooftop solar, SO FAST?  What kind of policy makes this possible? Do the projects even make money?  If you follow the China power sector, you've probably been wondering these things.  Last weekend, I went to the Shandong countryside to get answers.üßµ  https://t.co/NpwjhQv8mN

1621806970763358209 2023-02-04 09:44:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece @CurtExplores @DuoDuoTheCat That's exactly right. When you see yourself as superior to the locals (and they always do, regardless of whether they are explicit about it, or whether it only comes out after they've had a few beers) you can't see how other people could have a happy, fulfilling life here.
1621775149694611456 2023-02-04 07:38:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thocpodcast Isn't that the same thing the US natsec/intel Twitter people have been saying for 2 days now? i.e. "China has satellites why would they need a balloon?"
1621734535754031104 2023-02-04 04:56:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @williaminniss @Willjum1 This is quite a reasonable suggestion I think.

1621730058489720832 2023-02-04 04:39:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A short story:  Last night I was trying to refer to a poker chip in Chinese and my brain got frozen between Á≠πÁ†Å (casino token) and Á°¨Â∏Å (coin) and what came out of my mouth was Á≠πÂ∏Å and I was very embarrassed. The end.
1621544037475028992 2023-02-03 16:20:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JeffLonsdale @ruima And yes, this is one of those "take the L and shut the fuck up" moments, Jeff.  https://t.co/SaAUBSOMWr
1621543461907480576 2023-02-03 16:17:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JeffLonsdale @ruima So just to be clear - the "systemic discrimination" you were talking about is not being able to use your favorite social media?  And that's WORSE than being assaulted verbally (or sometimes physically) on the street?  Thanks, you have just redefined "fragile" for me.
1621452811727929345 2023-02-03 10:17:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Makes sense, considering geography.  I'd bet TW Mandarin is actually MORE distinct from Putonghua than TW Hokkien is from, e.g., Fuzhou Hokkien...
1621448404722384899 2023-02-03 09:59:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim English surely isn't even the most extreme example of a language with dialects that are essentially mutually unintelligible, but are still clearly considered to be the same language.  Are TW Hokkien and Fuzhou Hokkien even as distinct as the dialects of, say, Boston vs. Alabama?
1621446436188717056 2023-02-03 09:52:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Are people claiming that the difference between Taiwanese Hokkien and the Hokkien spoken in south Xiamen cities like Fuzhou, Quanzhou, or Xiamen, is so vast as to warrant distinction as separate languages?
1621437717216374788 2023-02-03 09:17:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @raid31nz this whole exchange is so difficult to follow I can't even tell if anyone is serious anymore
1621436645466853377 2023-02-03 09:13:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc I would bet a good number of those are  "captive power plants" i.e. a plant owned by and specifically built to power a nearby heavy industial facility.
1621431601887596547 2023-02-03 08:53:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JeffLonsdale @ruima Oh ffs what made you think this was a defensible claim to make?

Every time I want to complain about some ignorant or embarrassing behavior from expats in SH, I need to remind myself that it could be so much worse...I could live in TW and end up fully jokerized.

1621354673428140032 2023-02-03 03:47:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Very interesting work.
1621162523063115776 2023-02-02 15:03:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jerometenk @laurimyllyvirta It'll be Zhangqiu Á´†‰∏ò - a suburban district of Ji'nan.
1621149594599190533 2023-02-02 14:12:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker These provinces are looking everywhere for space to build renewables. They have domestic RPS mandates to meet, industry clamoring to buy green power, etc.  These aggregated rooftop solar projects offer a model that developers will be interested in, because they are profitable.
1621147833251553280 2023-02-02 14:05:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker Well, it's the only way to get any additional renewable capacity in the densely-populated coastal regions.  There's nowhere else for them to build.  Land usage fees are very high there, especially if it's occupying farm or forestland. Renting rooftops is cheap by comparison.
1621141689133072393 2023-02-02 13:41:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker By contrast, the regions with good solar are oversupplied and there's no way to get the power to somewhere that needs it, until more UHV lines come online.  We did a revenue forecast this year for a developer that wanted to build in Gansu and the projected returns were lousy!
1621141129411559426 2023-02-02 13:38:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker These eastern provinces like Zhejiang or Jiangsu have subpar solar resources versus Inner Mongolia, yes, but high base power prices and strong local demand, so the project developers have lower project risk choosing to build there - better guarantee on returns.
1621140383781765120 2023-02-02 13:36:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker If I had to guess, I'd say that the bulk of the new capacity this year has skewed towards Region 2/3 provinces, since that's where most of the counties participating in the Whole-County rooftop programmes are located. So capacity in Region 2/3 areas is probably ~70% now.
1621140140398878722 2023-02-02 13:35:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker At the end of 2021 (we don't have complete provincial data for 2022 yet) about 1/3rd of China's solar capacity was in provinces that would be categorized as Region 3 (poor) and another 1/3rd was in Region 2 (average). The last 1/3rd was in Region 1 (good).
1621118637317976065 2023-02-02 12:09:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bunter999 @davidfickling @AkshatRathi But subsidies should only be paid on volumes actually dispatched. Curtailed volumes weren't compensated.
1621076915942756352 2023-02-02 09:23:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @nuclearkatie @anna_biela3 @ramez This is great. Is that the sound of the first law of thermodynamics shattering?
1621022236298854400 2023-02-02 05:46:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @solar_chase @davidfickling @AkshatRathi Mhmmm. I was also reminded by others that there is another relevant thing that will distort calculations:   https://t.co/6WXeGaehEv
1621021110866448384 2023-02-02 05:42:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So a project around Chengdu would be treated like a project that was getting the sunlight of Western Sichuan (with a lower FiT rate). When in reality that area has some of the worst sunlight in the country.  No wonder Sichuan has so little solar capacity, even today.
1621021105376092161 2023-02-02 05:42:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Strangely, when China divided its solar resource zones (to regulate subsidy levels) it differentiated between e.g. the decent solar resources of North Hebei and poorer solar resources of South Hebei by splitting them, but ALL of Sichuan was considered the same zone (Zone 2).  https://t.co/SESUH6K2P8
1621021101693489153 2023-02-02 05:42:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Wow, look how terrible the solar resources is around Chengdu/Chongqing (thanks to the climate of the Sichuan Basin).  And then see Western Sichuan by contrast (which is all mountains, part of the Tibetan plateau).
1621017210553765888 2023-02-02 05:26:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @davidfickling Neat maps! Yeah I realized I wasn't precise enough at all. North Hebei is quite good for solar and Shandong is...alright. They aren't to blame. It's Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang that see a paltry 1000 generating hours annually, dragging the avg. down.
1621016580934213632 2023-02-02 05:24:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I've realized I wasn't being precise enough at all. North Hebei is actually quite good for solar, and Shandong isn't awful.  The provinces with a lot of capacity and sub-par irradiation that are dragging the average down are going to be Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui.  https://t.co/KWTqtQrwWL
1621015344088498176 2023-02-02 05:19:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GlennLuk I was probably unfairly picking on Shandong and Hebei. The real culprits with the low capacity factors are going to be a little further south:   https://t.co/TWkEwH9geC
1621014980211650560 2023-02-02 05:17:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ddjiii2 Actually Shandong isn't that bad, and (northern) Hebei is quite good - I picked on the wrong provinces  It's probably more the solar capacity in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and Henan that are dragging the average down.  Air pollution plays a factor too.  https://t.co/rnPLqxI35a
1621011643336638464 2023-02-02 05:04:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GlennLuk This is an important point too - there's always a surge of capacity in Nov/Dec during the shortest days of the year.  Better to look at capacity factor on a project level for  one full year of operation and then average the project-level data. Way more work though.
1620960182846255104 2023-02-02 01:39:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stepien_przemek @AkshatRathi @davidfickling That's also a very good point - the capacity additions are indeed always backloaded in the year.
1620864659464265728 2023-02-01 19:20:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @doconnoronca @GoodbertSensei @guptah21 @AkshatRathi @davidfickling The panels are installed in regions with poor irradiance
1620863970910572545 2023-02-01 19:17:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh yeah, and there is moderate curtailment risk in the west and northwest of the country, so that will chip away a few more points of capacity factor.  Very minor curtailment in the east though.  These are power importing provinces.
1620863216707579904 2023-02-01 19:14:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AkshatRathi @davidfickling I think I can answer this:   https://t.co/Ah7k6KBg3y
1620859834773143554 2023-02-01 19:01:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But anyway,  I don't think these numbers point to any problem with the quality of the panels, or the project owner's ability (or lack thereof) to get power out of them.  Just a feature (bug) of the trend in solar PV installation region for the last few years.
1620859832197844992 2023-02-01 19:01:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As the new Super Bases in the desert start to grid connect, we'll see new solar PV capacity coming online in areas that are actually good for it (paired with UHV lines to bring them to load centers). That should help to boost capacity factor.
1620859829568040961 2023-02-01 19:01:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So...for now, China has tons of capacity being installed in places with relatively poor sunlight, leading to relatively low generation for the capacity.  Try comparing just Inner Mongolia solar capacity vs. generation and you'll see a more reasonable capacity factor.
1620859826321620992 2023-02-01 19:01:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Which, as was noted in the Bloomberg piece, has also led to oversupply during daylight hours and very low spot market rates. It needs a correction for sure.  I plan to ask about this (and many other things) at the project I'm going to visit this weekend.   https://t.co/Egp6oaPke4
1620859823415001088 2023-02-01 19:01:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...and also policy mandates   https://t.co/MZbjNbS8xA
1620859820764188672 2023-02-01 19:01:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But those areas have weak power demand and are already oversaturated with power anyway.  Few project developers want to build there now because they can't make the revenue model make sense.  So instead they build on rooftops in eastern China, where there's demand.
1620859817882714112 2023-02-01 19:01:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The leading solar PV installed capacity provinces are Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Henan, etc.  None of these are good places to install solar from a solar irradiation perspective  You'll get way more generation for your capacity in Inner Mongolia or Gansu...  https://t.co/EHcHefPPNA
1620859813956845571 2023-02-01 19:01:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An interesting question - but one I think has a straightforward answer. @davidfickling @AkshatRathi   China's solar industry gets poorer performance on a capacity vs. generation basis because its panels are increasingly installed in areas that don't have good solar irradiance.
1620801241461972992 2023-02-01 15:08:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CelynBricker Yeah, the people looking back on it with nostalgia and fond memories, versus the people who are like "I have never considered that a place I would want to go".  I think it switches over at some point in history...maybe around 2010? I don't live there though so not sure.
1620798029753352192 2023-02-01 14:55:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Who knew that how you view the Sanlitun bar street would turn out to be some generation gap indicator like cassette vs. CD or dial-up versus broadband?
1620793669614968832 2023-02-01 14:38:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AnObscureAvi Oh yeah I just found it - seems the Chinese title is ‰ªé"Ê¥ãÂ®ÉÂ®É" Âà∞Â§ñ‰∫§ÂÆò -   Problem is, reading it in Chinese will take me at least 5x longer. I'm a speed reader in English, and in Chinese I'm very much...not üíÄ
1620779065795047426 2023-02-01 13:40:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AnObscureAvi I came across this while I was looking him up! I'd very much like to read it, but not sure where to find it here. Perhaps another trip to the foreign language bookstore.
1620761412607045633 2023-02-01 12:30:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Yep - Maine has fiddleheads.  There's a dish made all over but especially in SW China called Ëï®Ê†πÁ≤â made from dried and ground-up fern...flour I guess?
1620739204589432832 2023-02-01 11:01:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaGSProject I promise to stop complaining about bad op-eds in the WSJ after seeing this.
1620734566842662919 2023-02-01 10:43:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @michaelbushe @ruima No, you didn't.
1620722218492891137 2023-02-01 09:54:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And finally, because it wouldn't be a thread of mine without a dumb error/typo, and I already hit ‚Äútweet‚Äù...  The trip started on Jan 28, not the 29th!  They flew on the 28th, but because they flew to the Western Hemisphere, it was still the 28th when they landed. Dumb.üò≥  End.
1620722215229734913 2023-02-01 09:54:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The author thinks this is the only such account of this trip, in such detail, as he followed Deng on all 9 days. He's probably right.  Anyway - if you're a China nerd, it's worth a read, if you can find a copy. if you happen to be in SH, I'm happy to lend you mine.
1620722210808922112 2023-02-01 09:54:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But of course, the author has his own biases, which he readily acknowledges.  At the time, he was at the China Daily News ÁæéÂ∑ûÂçé‰æ®Êó•Êä•, which he describes as the only pro-China Chinese language newspaper in New York in that era.  It published its last edition in 1989.  https://t.co/T3jFkOh01X
1620722207575117825 2023-02-01 09:54:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But from my reading of the author, he appears to interpret TW as perhaps the only issue for which Deng was leaving without total satisfaction - an unhealed wound that obviously remains unhealed, and foreign lobby influence is as strong in the US today as then, if not stronger.
1620722204332924929 2023-02-01 09:54:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One thing that struck me while reading the sections on USA-China-TW issues, however, is how familiar the discussions and sticking points are from 1979 to today. Deng came to the US with an clear agenda, and he mostly succeeded in his political, economic, and trade goals.
1620722201032028160 2023-02-01 09:54:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The books adds pages and pages of backstory on the political context of the time: US-Soviet tensions, Sino-Soviet tensions, Vietnam, and especially Taiwan. This trip changed the trajectory of many of these things, although I won't summarize that all here...read it yourself!
1620722196497965058 2023-02-01 09:54:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, this trip was a Huge Deal at the time, from the way it is described, with domestic coverage fixated on Deng and his group, e.g., the Atlanta Constitution dedicated 7 PAGES to Deng's visit to the city. Stunning really, to see how much the times have changed.
1620722189820661761 2023-02-01 09:54:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 19. Deng seemingly also had a taste for Coca-Cola, preferring at dinner several times, including at the Seattle dinner. Coke would enter the China market shortly thereafter, although it would only be available at the "Friendship Stores".
1620722184569380866 2023-02-01 09:54:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 18. In Seattle, Deng also attended a dinner with business leaders including executives from United Airlines, who wanted to open the first US-China passenger route.  Pan-Am had applied first, but in the end, Pan-Am's application failed because they were running flights to Taipei.  https://t.co/mjhkdZG4vG
1620720813770158080 2023-02-01 09:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 17. Fang Yi went to visit McDonnell-Douglas to talk about civil passenger airplanes, but the President of the company wasn't available to meet them...because he was already in Beijing, negotiating the sale of aircraft.  Meanwhile, Deng visited Boeing to talk about buying more.
1620720806937649152 2023-02-01 09:48:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16. After Houston, Deng went to Seattle, while Fang Yi went to California. Both trips were focused on airplanes and imported aircraft technology. Deng also visited the Port of Seattle, which began serving as the main terminal to export corn to China just a few months later.
1620720801552166912 2023-02-01 09:48:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15. In Houston, a member of the local KKK tried to assault Deng while he was heading from his hotel to leave for the rodeo. The attacker was squashed by US security agents. The author observed the event personally and provided a play by play in the book.  https://t.co/yOXmbhWbZE
1620720787635191808 2023-02-01 09:48:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14. The Houston part of the trip was about oil drilling and spaceflight. At the time, China was still an oil exporter and every American oil company wanted in.  This is also where Deng went to a rodeo and got that famous picture with the cowboy hat.  https://t.co/lrnfwugqaK
1620720776621223937 2023-02-01 09:48:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13. Governor Busbee of Georgia hosted a dinner for the Chinese group, with other governors invited. This was day 5 and it seems Deng had already been served veal for dinner several times...lol  A young Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas, also attended this dinner.  https://t.co/4SqjBoJlGk
1620720767356002304 2023-02-01 09:48:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12. In Atlanta, Deng visited a Ford production plant and the MLK memorial, while Fang Yi went to Georgia Tech. Ford had already led a trade delegation to Beijing the year before and was keen to get into China.  The technology, economic and trade part of the trip had begun.
1620720762062766081 2023-02-01 09:48:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11. Deng's itinerary after DC was Atlanta, Houston, &amp; Seattle. Fang Yi had a slightly different trip. The visits after DC were based on science, technology, &amp; trade.  Their plane followed them around, but they didn't use it, because they were flown around on Air Force One.
1620720756727623681 2023-02-01 09:48:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10. Deng made himself available for media interviews, a trend that seems to have died after Jiang Zemin.  In addition to giving a long 1v1 interview to Time Magazine just before the trip, he did a live TV interview with ABC, NBC, CBS and PBS on day 4.
1620720751476379650 2023-02-01 09:48:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9. Zhuo Lin (Deng's wife) was apparently quite proficient in English (unlike Deng) and fairly chatty with Rosalyn Carter without any interpreter nearby.  Supposedly she was even cracking jokes about the protestors during the opening speeches.  https://t.co/g4fsjnlFmn
1620720731998027778 2023-02-01 09:48:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When Nixon came to China in 1972,  Deng was in the middle of one of his "up-and-down" trips of disgrace and redemption, doing hard labor in a factory in Jiangxi at the time, so they had never met.  He apparently had a sense of humor about his "three ups and three downs" though:  https://t.co/RTPG1py3l8
1620720723974320128 2023-02-01 09:48:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8. Supposedly Nixon was only invited to the state dinner at the White House on the 2nd day of the trip because Deng really wanted to see him, although Carter didn't want him there.  He told the US side if Nixon wasn't invited, he would go visit Nixon at his home in CA. Awkward.  https://t.co/k6B39MGtVS
1620720714335784960 2023-02-01 09:48:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7. in DC, Deng had 3 private sit-downs with Carter, plus 2 shorter meetings. The only other person present was interpreter Ji Chaozhu.  The US side didn't have any interpreters for the trip and relied on the ones China had brought (some of the US advisors spoke Chinese though).  https://t.co/OwgiYYJ6LP
1620720707205476352 2023-02-01 09:48:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The anecdote continues, somewhat ironically noting that Deng's adversaries from both the left and right seemed to have no trouble temporarily allying in protest of his trip.  Ling Yun, security head for the Chinese delegation, delivered this zinger:  https://t.co/codNF2Usgu
1620720683096637440 2023-02-01 09:48:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. Predictably, Deng faced small protests in every city he visited. The US pro-TW lobby organized most of them, but he also faced attacks from the left, who denounced him for betraying Mao's legacy.  This incident is described from the morning of Day 2 during Carter's address:  https://t.co/8Cs6VD3n1Y
1620720679523086337 2023-02-01 09:48:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also a funny bit that doesn't matter at all in the big picture, but apparently Mrs. Brzezinski let her veal get a little too brown and there was a distinct smoky odor in the house that evening when Deng's group arrived.  It's 44 years later and I still feel bad for her lol.
1620720676079542272 2023-02-01 09:48:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Oh yes" Deng reportedly said, upon which the US side thought he was about to reveal some interesting anecdotes about the Chinese domestic political scene, but then he dryly added "there are some people in Taiwan that don't like me".  Which apparently got a chuckle.
1620720672619245573 2023-02-01 09:48:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Based on later stories from attendees, there were a few amusing anecdotes:  Brzezinksi told Deng that Carter had faced much opposition in Congress while trying to normalize relations, due to the pro-TW lobby, and asked Deng if he ever had to deal with similar issues.
1620720668127166465 2023-02-01 09:48:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. On the first night, Deng's group attended a private family dinner hosted at the home of National Security Advisor Brzezinski, which apparently was the result of a promise made during talks in BJ the year before. No media were admitted, so this dinner was a bit of a mystery.
1620720663102386178 2023-02-01 09:48:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. The flight from BJ transferred first in SH, then Anchorage, then continued on to Andrews Air Force Base.  US VP Walter Mondale and his wife met them personally on the ground, which hadn't been revealed to media, and so was a surprising upgrade in diplomatic etiquette.
1620720657221971971 2023-02-01 09:48:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. But there were future VIPs as well:  -Deng's interpreter, Ji Chaozhu, would later be ambassador to the UK and a UN USG  -Huang Hua's interpreter was a young Yang Jiechi, future US Ambassador &amp; State Council member  -The pilot, Xu Bailing, later was Air China's first President
1620720653807792128 2023-02-01 09:48:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Deng, at the time the Vice-Chairman and Vice Premier, was accompanied by an impressive list of officials and their spouses.  Besides Deng, other VIPs included Foreign Minister Huang Hua and Vice Premier Fang Yi (who was also president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences).
1620720648736894976 2023-02-01 09:48:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. Deng's retinue departed from Beijing on January 29, 1979, on the first day of the Chinese New Year.   Truly a symbolically significant time to embark on such a trip - this timing can only be assumed to be intentional and I hope it was recognized appropriately.
1620720644987179010 2023-02-01 09:48:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I won't break down the whole book - that wouldn't be fair to the author - but I'll share a few observations I found noteworthy.  Unfortunately I dunno where you can buy this 2020 book as it's out of stock on Amazon. I picked mine up at the foreign language bookstore in SH.
1620720639383572480 2023-02-01 09:48:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In honor of the 44th anniversary of Deng's historic US visit, I recently read this book "9 Days: Deng Xiaoping in the U.S."  This is the story of Deng's trip to the US in January 1979. It had some anecdotes &amp; stories I'd not seen anywhere else.üßµ  https://t.co/hDc1suxlXf
1620659545688379392 2023-02-01 05:45:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @liqian_ren In Shanghai I know at least one Carrefour (Wuning Rd) closed and another was converted into the "Carrefour Club" concept that looks like was modeled directly after Costco/Sam's.  They're definitely trying to course correct in response to the popularity of the new guys.
1620655958157565952 2023-02-01 05:31:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Chenjuan In Shanghai, the license plate might cost several times more than the car itself, unless there's a subsidy program going on...

1620392959031246848 2023-01-31 12:06:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @idlersoup @chris__pc @PleannSh You'll have to find someone who knows more about EV chargers and their business model - I'm not that guy :)
1620390096955641856 2023-01-31 11:54:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc @PleannSh Looks expensive. Was it a NIO branded charger? Any special surcharges you saw?  415 CNY for 71 kWh works out to ~5.8 CNY/kWh...that's a lot.  Here are the rates for a State Grid branded charger I saw in Ezhou, Hubei for contrast- peak period (8pm-10pm) was only 2.2552 CNY/kWh.  https://t.co/5QrT8dA0Nq
1620349236083847169 2023-01-31 09:12:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc @J_A_Quent Pretty sure I missed one about: should you turn your lights on, or turn your HIGH beams on when entering a tunnel...?  Dunno what the others were though.
1620348450813653002 2023-01-31 09:09:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc @J_A_Quent Well, to be more precise, it was 5 separate days, reviewing ~300 questions each time, spread over a period of 2 weeks. Then one final review of the 10% or so that I got wrong in the first pass.  But honestly I thought I had missed 2 maximum so it was surprising lol.
1620344193959993345 2023-01-31 08:52:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @chris__pc Yeah then you just gotta master some of the weird things, like the awkward wording on some of the questions.  Definitely go through the whole 1500 questions in app and save the ones you got wrong and review them.  I studied on and off for ~2 weeks and got a 93 on my first try.
1620338575882752000 2023-01-31 08:29:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @chris__pc Yeah that's the one I used. It's quite accurate - I even got a few of the weird questions in the app worded exactly the same way on the official test.  Just turn off your brain, stop trying to use logic, and memorize... üòÖ
1620337668168253440 2023-01-31 08:26:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker All good questions - I know some already but I'll wait until I have the direct answers from the developer and do a full write-up
1620337514157576193 2023-01-31 08:25:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Got it - will ask them about everything üòâ  (but yes I'll do a full write-up after)
1620337396641574912 2023-01-31 08:25:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BryanKWChan Yes. Over the last year, distributed solar was almost the only type of project that met developer IRR hurdle rates in Shandong. But if the portion that offtakes to the grid is more exposed to spot pricing, they will also start struggling to make money...
1620336754409771010 2023-01-31 08:22:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jim_smoot I'll ask if these distributed county-level projects are being paired with any storage on the generator-end. There's a pretty bad daytime glut of solar, so it might make economic sense.  Shandong as a province is building out something like 4GW of pumped storage before 2025.
1620336149444317185 2023-01-31 08:20:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JohnyKe_93 Shandong is already severely "duck curved" because of projects like this.  Exports to grid are usually coal benchmark but some provinces have been mandating a portion or all to be at the market spot price instead... üòí   https://t.co/19iEAXW0t6
1620335545556795393 2023-01-31 08:17:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JohnyKe_93 For commercial buildings, factories, hospitals, schools, gov't buildings etc., it's "self-use and export the rest to the grid" ÔºàËá™ÂèëËá™Áî®‰ΩôÁîµ‰∏äÁΩëÔºâ  Residential rooftop owners usually don't have the self-use option - this is a purely a rental arrangement to use their roof.
1620334321960914944 2023-01-31 08:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielOlimac @crehage That's exactly who he is. That's why he's acting defensive and whiny about it.
1620333351709315074 2023-01-31 08:09:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc @J_A_Quent I found the smartshanghai guide about the DMV procedures quite comprehensive and effective.
1620329285931393024 2023-01-31 07:53:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc That bright red car in the new year is auspicious AF. They're getting good fortune just by hanging out near you.
1620326097954160641 2023-01-31 07:40:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris_fba4u I did some Googling and it seems they're way more common with young hens, so it seems if a producer has a flock of younger chickens, they're much more common. I guess I've spent my life eating old hen eggs lol
1620317447051173893 2023-01-31 07:05:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChadCTNKE I was waiting for someone to mention that too
1620312995300786178 2023-01-31 06:48:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WildPixels Hah definitely going to get the local PSB crew involved next time I encounter this
1620302502599233540 2023-01-31 06:06:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @zhao_dashuai *Weak arguments from the perspective of the intended audience anyway, as you mentioned.   We know the Chinese audience finds them compelling, but that doesn't help much.
1620294902507802626 2023-01-31 05:36:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LeaningEmma My pillsbury doughboy ass is on keto right now so no :(   (Yes it's been as hard as you can imagine considering the quantity of bread in my home right now)
1620293018443198464 2023-01-31 05:28:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @zhao_dashuai I have no doubt you'll deploy it flawlessly the next time you have the chance, adding to your already admirably robust collection of Western cultural touchstone references.  And...Yes.
1620288349658558464 2023-01-31 05:10:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @zhao_dashuai Exactly.  To swap metaphors...  If you bench your best players, don't be shocked when the JV squad gets walloped.  But I also don't think the opposing side ever really recognizes that they're beating up the JV team. They think they're kicking ass.
1620284928733884417 2023-01-31 04:56:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @zhao_dashuai I always get a kick of out the people who dedicate themselves to refuting what they see as weak arguments from CN outlets.  It's like marching to the castle and saying "I wish to challenge your champion, but not a strong one. One of your weak, undernourished champions will do".
1620263481307181057 2023-01-31 03:31:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai Fantastic wind power resources...the best in China. That's all I know about it :)

1620258823671021568 2023-01-31 03:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai Interesting and good to know. I doubt any of those last three see much non-Chinese tourist traffic? I've never been.
1620257194133581827 2023-01-31 03:06:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman I think that might be the hotel/guesthouse owner taking on some personal risk:   https://t.co/Sm7H7BdxfH
1620255649274953728 2023-01-31 03:00:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman The original poster was in a township that only has ONE hotel on Ctrip in the first place (which says it doesn't accept foreigners) - I tried checking.
1620255124978536448 2023-01-31 02:58:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent OH that's happened to me before too. They specifically said they weren't accepting foreigners during a certain sensitive time period - one of the national congresses I believe. üíÄ
1620254853829394433 2023-01-31 02:57:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent Sigh. Yeah if it happened to me in BJ, I definitely wouldn't make the effort to fight it - there are plenty of options. Gotta get more creative when you're down in the country.
1620251134878437377 2023-01-31 02:42:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moosefly24 Oh yeah we never had any weird stuff. Small town vibes, everyone knew each other...customers and staff.
1620250847811887104 2023-01-31 02:41:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW I've never seen any compelling evidence that this behavior is driven by "wanting foreigners to stay in expensive hotels", a popular theory I don't subscribe to.  I think that's looking for conspiracy when good old fashioned laziness/ÊÄïÈ∫ªÁÉ¶ is to blame.
1620250844875878400 2023-01-31 02:41:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My rough guesstimate on hotel availability for non-Chinese is:  1st tier: Most hotels okay 2nd tier cities: ~50% 3rd-5th tier cities: 10-5% Townships: 1-2 at most unless it's touristy Villages: Barely have hotels anyway, unless it's touristy  So yeah it can get tough.
1620250840463466496 2023-01-31 02:41:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think this is only NECESSARY when you're way out in the country. The place he mentions here is a township Âº†ÂÖ∞Èïá.   My experience has been you'll have to be in a county-level city or higher to find at least one hotel that won't give you grief. A place with chains.
1620250837300948995 2023-01-31 02:41:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I've been to at least one hotel before that said they were fine with this approach.  (The problem was that the PSB was closed so I ended up not doing it anyway. It was Changsha, so I found another place easily enough).   https://t.co/f54yst0TR0
1620250833937141760 2023-01-31 02:41:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I advocate the best move in this situation is to FIRST trot over to the local PSB and register (since the hotel is supposed to, but won't) and THEN go to the hotel to wave your registration form at them, robbing them of their most likely excuse (and remind them of the law).
1620235994221133824 2023-01-31 01:42:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mihaiam It's not an error bar - it's a range of results from different studies. It looks like there's at least one that was much higher than the average - I'd be curious to see how this outlier got those results. Let me see if I can find it.
1620232824438816768 2023-01-31 01:29:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moosefly24 For us, it helped that it's a town of 4000 people and so it's almost definitely somebody at least one person working there knows already.
1620025458426548224 2023-01-30 11:45:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai @ForeignerJose Well, they'll "work" as long as there's sun. üòâ  It's up to the project developer to determine if they can be profitable with just 800 or 900 generation hours/annum vs. a place with better solar resources that gets 1200 or 1500 or more.

1619568335074787328 2023-01-29 05:29:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gayestgaymer1 In China, we saw steel move to Yunnan to use hydro (not because they wanted to be green, but because it was cheap; partial decarbonization was just a side effect).   Beyond that, the hope is green hydrogen I guess. Steel will probably be one of the last sectors to decarbonize.
1619553443982745604 2023-01-29 04:30:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> tl;dr  It's valid to remember upstream emissions, and not let them be glossed over, but where we are now is just a logical first step in an ongoing effort.  Industrial process decarbonization is coming next, and in China at least, it shows promise to be both cleaner AND cheaper.
1619553365939339266 2023-01-29 04:29:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And that's exactly what's happening when some breathless media piece talks up the "dirty secret" of technology XX without explaining the long-term plan.  Or when some dishonest pundit uses it as a cudgel.  They're doing you, me, and the world a disservice.
1619553295978360832 2023-01-29 04:29:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But deep decarbonization is decades away.  Right now, there are major gains to be enjoyed by creating ample affordable low-carbon power generation, to be used in decarbonizing the upstream "dirty" raw materials segment.  It's ignorant or disingenuous to work against this.
1619553249782284289 2023-01-29 04:29:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, over the long term, deep decarbonization of industry or transport will need something more. A breakthrough technology (like green hydrogen, or getting carbon capture to actually work).  (Or else a bunch of countries drastically change their stance on nuclear üòï)
1619551747034456064 2023-01-29 04:23:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Notice I emphasized "affordable" low-carbon power. I don't think it's feasible to demand industrial producers take on big cost hikes to decarbonize production. They will pass those costs to consumers.  But I don't think cost competitiveness will be a issue. At least not in China.
1619551744069099520 2023-01-29 04:23:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Once you have affordable low-carbon power to use as an industrial input, you have more options, e.g.:  1. Electrifying industrial processes that previously combusted fossil fuels  2. Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power as an input  3. Synthesizing alternative fuels
1619551741183414273 2023-01-29 04:23:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The fact is, NONE of this is a deal-killer for any technology -  it just exemplifies how downstream power generation must be decarbonized BEFORE upstream industrial processes can be as well. That's the key point.  It's a process, and this is just the start of that process...
1619551738083827713 2023-01-29 04:23:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (And please note that I'm REALLY not interested in re-litigating with you today whether clean technology X is marginally better than clean technology Y because of ABC. If you hop into my mentions to do this, I'm muting you.  ALL of the low-carbon options have a role to play)
1619551735009394692 2023-01-29 04:23:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So "silicon for solar panels is produced with coal power" is true...but also a red herring.  It's a bad faith ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (used by people ignoring how their own favorite technology is also exposed to carbon-intensive processes).  How do you think steel or concrete are made?
1619551730894766086 2023-01-29 04:23:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I mean‚Ä¶for starters, life-cycle studies still show a big emissions gap on /kWh basis for burning fossil fuels for power versus using OTHER power generation sources, EVEN with fossil fuels somewhere in the upstream process. It's not even close.  Left: NREL; Right: WNA.  https://t.co/hm1K8VnCvi
1619551727660978176 2023-01-29 04:23:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A üßµon a thing that's been bugging me on a misconception in clean energy tech.  Yes it's important to do full accounting of life-cycle emissions for "dirty" upstream raw materials like silicon, concrete, steel, copper, uranium, etc.  But their existence is not a "gotcha".
1619526928322686976 2023-01-29 02:44:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @spaceandweather That's already great for just getting started.  üí™Overtraining and hurting yourself at the beginning is super common. Your joints (especially knees and ankles) will probably be especially vulnerable at the start.
1619524093916889089 2023-01-29 02:33:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MagusMagician Ohhh yes I've done that. I called the driver, told him he was free to mark as "already delivered" and picked it up myself
1619516225532600320 2023-01-29 02:02:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MagusMagician Okay but why lol. Were your hands fullÔºü
1619513956892315648 2023-01-29 01:53:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @msittig @moshaosen Pleco actually supports that too, but I rarely use it since the handwriting recognition is already good. It's worth remembering how to use it for sure through.  https://t.co/56ho8Zxwlq

1619349182988570626 2023-01-28 14:58:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @firstadopter We don't do "weekly shopping" because we buy fresh things every few days. This order was:  1lb Chicken legs @ USD 1.80/lb 2lbs Chicken breasts @ USD 1.45/lb A head of lettuce @ USD 0.93 A bag of mixed salad greens @ USD 3.10 32 eggs @ USD 4.71 Bulb of ginger @ USD 0.65
1619348816398012416 2023-01-28 14:56:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @firstadopter Really depends if you're buying from wet markets or imported grocery etc. Huge variation. Delivery fee doesn't change much unless it's very heavy.  In USD, this order came to about 16 bucks. "Packaging fee" was 30 cents. Delivery fee was 73 cents.

1619318164650860544 2023-01-28 12:55:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina I had a phase where I was learning chengyu and kept manipulating conversations to get to the point where I could use a chengyu and my friends begged me to stop
1619317279187152899 2023-01-28 12:51:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @drStuartGilmour Yeah I really doubt I could learn Chinese now as a hobby alongside a full-time job and social media habit... üòÇ
1619316648342876161 2023-01-28 12:49:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaNotes Yeah I wasn't sure where the original asker's starting point was, but it seemed to me like they were just starting out.
1619316039996801029 2023-01-28 12:46:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moshaosen This is a good tip - our textbook also had the 40 most common radicals at the start of the book and we reviewed them in class so we were familiar with what to expect when we saw ÈíÖÔºåÊ∞µÔºå Áä≠Ôºå etc.
1619314280050081794 2023-01-28 12:39:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nuclearbackupf1 You're correct. Nearly never handwrite stuff beyond my signature and occasionally my address- pinyin input programs make it really easy. I've forgotten how to write many characters, even simple ones, because I haven't handwritten anything significant for years.
1619280914554720256 2023-01-28 10:27:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Joseph_Huber_ The driver's rating explicitly supports the driver. In fact it's good policy to just give your driver five stars even if their performance was nothing special, since drivers with lower ratings (often for something they can't control) will face pressure from managers.
1619277837256761344 2023-01-28 10:14:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> - Any other Chinese learners from my community - feel free to add anything here that you've found helpful.
1619277834643734530 2023-01-28 10:14:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. I watched TV shows for new characters - not to enjoy the plot. I paused constantly to write down new characters into my notebook. Then a few days later I would try to re-watch the episode and see how many I remembered.  This is more for intermediate learners I think.
1619277832357838848 2023-01-28 10:14:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course there are still lots of important words that use this character that aren't part of the HSK database. Like there's an example in this list - ÈùôÈü≥, to mute (like muting your phone).  But it really helped me learn new characters and words in clusters.
1619277828310310912 2023-01-28 10:14:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. When I checked new characters, I would go on MDBG and search for the character with asterisks on either side, like this: *Èùô*  Then I would write down every HSK-level word in the database that used that character:  So in this example, I would learn 6 new words from Èùô.  https://t.co/iXRg3tjwhD
1619277826032807936 2023-01-28 10:14:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As for remembering characters, there's three things I can think of specifically:  1. I had a notebook of new characters anytime I found one. Whether it was on a sign, a text from a friend, or in a TV show, I would write its pronunciation and meaning and review each week.
1619277822312456192 2023-01-28 10:14:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And pay attention to - and try to properly implement - correct stroke order.  Sometimes the rules seem kinda arbitrary at first, but after a while, it becomes second nature, and then the stroke order rules can actually help you remember how to write characters.  https://t.co/oHqlXNwMUR
1619277818478870528 2023-01-28 10:14:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Remembering how to write characters requires brute force repetition. Unless you have savant memory, you just need to practice writing them over and over again. Get some of those practice books with the outlines that Chinese kids use to learn their characters, like this:  https://t.co/JhJO7C5chY
1619277814129373184 2023-01-28 10:14:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hey - I don't, and I'm not sure my experience is replicable, since I majored in Chinese in college...so I didn't have the experience of trying to learn while I was already working, or trying to have a life doing other stuff, etc. It's different.  But I can offer a few tips:
1619249344393416705 2023-01-28 08:21:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wtruszczynska Must have been pretty close! Maybe the owner walked it over and dropped it off personally~
1619242406104399872 2023-01-28 07:54:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @omonrise Well the target delivery time wasn't actually for another 20 minutes, but yeah, I hear you. For groceries there's really no need to deliver so fast  For meals though, there's no way to get around certain time limitations without losing much of the value of the delivery.
1619236034184888323 2023-01-28 07:28:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman Exactly! That's what I thought too.
1619232184002547713 2023-01-28 07:13:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent This button on the order completion page  https://t.co/SX1dKv6bT1
1619230210725154816 2023-01-28 07:05:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Gave the guy a tip and a 5star rating. He's probably been hustling like crazy during the holiday with so many drivers back in their hometowns and that was super impressive.
1619227874749485056 2023-01-28 06:56:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I just placed a grocery order from an Aldi 2km away on Meituan and it arrived in ELEVEN MINUTES.  The drive itself takes like 8 minutes.  That means the driver was already in the store, and the staff took 3 minutes to assemble my order?  Why would anyone leave their home? lol  https://t.co/Ec9Inja4jl

1618521175558344705 2023-01-26 08:08:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GDTVhazza @realsteelmuslim @Dier0806 This of course was poor education/ignorance about the inbound quarantine, allowing people to believe that foreigners were somehow "riskier", and needed to be treated with increased caution.  Never had any physical altercations or anything, just constantly aware I was seen as sus.
1618520797093724160 2023-01-26 08:06:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GDTVhazza @realsteelmuslim @Dier0806 I can say over the last 3 years, I've experienced for the first time some negative interactions that had never come up before, from people refusing to take an elevator with me, to them changing seats on the subway when I sat down. It was all covid-related stuff for sure.
1618503924109180929 2023-01-26 06:59:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango What do you want as an answer...what I would probably do myself, or what you probably *should* do? üòÖ  (and that phrasing should make it clear what both are)
1618503173127438339 2023-01-26 06:56:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MAIhab5 I'll be sure to pass your commentary up to the NDRC and NEA. They'll be keen to know how to improve their work to your satisfaction.
1618502646947803138 2023-01-26 06:54:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ausmschneider France has been this low for years - sometimes even lower.  There's been a mild long-term trend of declining CF in France, related maybe to aging plants/unplanned outages/mistimed outages. It was a point of discussion last year I recall.   https://t.co/LqfSQI0wPr
1618444107776688128 2023-01-26 03:01:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And for that to happen, they will need to be pushed into the merchant market to compete freely with other generation sources, which is already happening for some plants.  In China, nuclear owners have nothing to fear from the merchant market - they should be quite competitive.
1618443650593337344 2023-01-26 03:00:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's not to say that their availability will decrease - they'll still operate at these very high rates if needed. Average CF in China was 92.27% in 2021.  But I think they'll be expected to operate more flexibly to push out coal plants, which perform this flex function now.  https://t.co/s6wxVZdGnE
1618442165453221889 2023-01-26 02:54:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the future, if China starts to build more nuclear in places that need it to operate as a flex generator, I'd expect capacity factors to drop and start looking more like France's.  As it is now, Chinese nuclear plants' CF look much like these other countries - well above 90%

1618265371353677824 2023-01-25 15:11:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck That's the plan I guess
1618199048917504000 2023-01-25 10:48:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta yep...
1618191454433841152 2023-01-25 10:18:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some will remember how Êï£ÁÖ§ "loose coal" was banned for residential heating in BJ, Hebei, and other northern provinces that suffered from bad haze in the winter.  In times like this, local officials may have no choice but to quietly loosen such restrictions/look the other way...
1618191451132919810 2023-01-25 10:18:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unlike the giant SOE power generators with deep pockets to underwrite coal-power generation losses, these are small, privatized, local gas companies.  They can't afford to sell gas at a loss, but they aren't allowed to charge a cost-recovery rate (nor could buyers afford it).
1618191446980591616 2023-01-25 10:18:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This piece contains a quote from my @LantauGroup colleague Jenny Zhang (not on Twitter) who points how local gas distributors in Hebei are stuck buying high-priced imported gas, yet are restricted by how much they can charge residential gas customers, making them unprofitable.
1618166624980434944 2023-01-25 08:39:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy I promise to not gatekeep my airports
1618152565610545154 2023-01-25 07:43:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Yes probably...  Wuhan was intending to administratively swallow Ezhou right up until last year, when it was veteod in Beijing.
1618150831890763776 2023-01-25 07:36:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Whatever happens economy-wise, the airport is certainly convenient for the ~9M residents of the 3 cities.  In Huangshi, they told me it used to be a 2hr drive to get to the closest airport in Wuhan. Now it's 20 minutes away.  And parcels now arrive much faster than they used to.
1618150828254298112 2023-01-25 07:36:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...But people in the (much more developed) Huangshi told me they have a lot less available land, so they also aren't confident that they'll get a lot of the new industry.  They think the companies will go to Ezhou, where land is much cheaper...Hah.
1618150824982765571 2023-01-25 07:36:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The main reason for this being that although they need it the most, the local government can't afford to offer tax breaks and other perks to companies.  They worry that Huangshi and Huanggang, not Ezhou, will see most of the rewards brought by the airport.
1618150821262393345 2023-01-25 07:36:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Companies will choose their location for large facilities based on perks offered by the local government and the cost of land.  Ezhou is the poorest/least developed of the 3. People there told me they aren't optimistic that Ezhou will see a lot of benefit from the airport...
1618150816682217474 2023-01-25 07:36:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Located between the cities of Ezhou, Huangshi, and Huanggang, (in blue) the airport (in red) should bring economic benefit to all three cities via logistics, cold chain storage, and other related industries.  But all three cities will be competing for these industries.  https://t.co/niGMtKOivm
1618150798307004416 2023-01-25 07:36:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also, the final bit of the highway connection to the airport isn't finished yet, so the only way to get to the airport from Ezhou is via tiny village roads to the north of the airport.  Of course there's also an unfinished "Airport Industry Econpmic Development Zone".  https://t.co/wEkMOiSIpS
1618150781756264448 2023-01-25 07:36:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's probably not easy to see here, but the area around the airport is just farmland and barren hilltops.  Some of the hilltops had to be chopped off to provide better lines of sight for the runway so the landscape around the airport is just giant piles of red clay and boulders.  https://t.co/Ubjlp2azsW
1618150755999043587 2023-01-25 07:36:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There weren't many cars in the parking lot, but I noticed about 30% of the parking spaces were set up for EV recharging.  This charging equipment had a pretty mural painted on it.  https://t.co/ZH0GQovCOv
1618150639187677184 2023-01-25 07:35:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next door is the cargo airport, which is the reason for this airport's existence. ShunFeng also has a major logistics center and office here.   Everything is brand new... this airport opened in July.  https://t.co/vrFHS3T7Az
1618150586314289152 2023-01-25 07:35:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The passenger terminal is just this one hall, with entry, exit, check-in, security, and a convenience store all in the same place.  Today, there are 4 flights. The ticket attendant told me there will be 7 flights tomorrow.  It reminds me of the the airport in Bangor, Maine.  https://t.co/dnbVPwwdJR

This airport is actually primarily a cargo airport operated by Shunfeng, but with a small passenger terminal too, running just a few flights per day.  https://t.co/sPCyA9cHSW

Really screwed with pacing too.  Oh and the non-Chinese actors were really bad for the most part. Especially that angry guy going a discount Christian Bale Batman accent.

1617752545220517888 2023-01-24 05:13:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ShangguanJiewen It must be something. Most capacity installed in that month? Or some other specific thing like that.

Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia will lead for utility-scale but many provinces in the east have a lot of capacity from rooftop solar, which causes them to lead in the overall rankings.  #2 Hebei has installed a lot of solar to help Xiong'an to become 100% green.  https://t.co/aJDGsGCnzo

1616726354606850048 2023-01-21 09:16:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> However CNY is the time to splurge, and so in the end we still spent something like 800 CNY total (115 USD) on a massive hoard of fruit that I am now under great pressure to eat before it all goes bad in a few days.

1616726344729260034 2023-01-21 09:16:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The in-laws told me normally going to the wholesale market is a good way to get both better produce that hasn't been pawed over by everyone else, AND cheaper prices.  But not during CNY - the prices here right now are the same as the fruit shops in the city.  https://t.co/KTpIayBFcd
1616726236092567552 2023-01-21 09:15:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I found it was a good place to find certain items that wouldn't be shipped in large quantities to neighborhood fruit stores because they aren't so popular or are out of season.  I saw durian, jackfruit, and cherries, which I hadn't seen at the smaller fruit stores.  https://t.co/Wf6KqVCjYH
1616726164634230785 2023-01-21 09:15:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course besides citrus, there were a lot of other fruits on offer, but the popularity of oranges and tangerines reigned supreme.  This gentleman's shop was filled with nothing but crates and crates of tangerines...  https://t.co/NR0es82h1N
1616726116743667713 2023-01-21 09:15:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The wholesale market was hidden behind a gas station on the edge of town. About half the vendors were still open despite the holiday and business was brisk - lots of people know about this place.  The ground was covered in orange peels and everything smelled like overripe fruit.  https://t.co/DyFNlvBHAT
1616726076281192450 2023-01-21 09:15:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, we picked up some lil' tangerines and some of these big wrinkly bois called Á≤ëÁ≤ëÊüë (giant tangerines?)  And then off to the wholesale market because the in-laws weren't satisfied with the price or quality or something. Ezhou dialect always sounds angry so I'm not sure.  https://t.co/BVIXeqvpRK
1616726001979129856 2023-01-21 09:14:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And it's amazing the variety of citrus...all these specific sub-species of Ê©ôs and Ê°îs and Ê©òs and Êüös and Êüës.  ...but then literally every single apple is Fuji. Shandong Fuji, Shaanxi Fuji, Xinjiang Fuji.  It turns out even "Aksu Apple" is just a rebranded Fuji.  https://t.co/cogvObsk8K
1616725939551076353 2023-01-21 09:14:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway the citrus supply in the fruit stores of Ezhou, Hubei is out of control - literally overflowing onto the sidewalks in many cases.  This must be the busiest time of the year for citrus sellers.  (also saw a ton of sugar cane)  https://t.co/Fqlmy8r63L
1616725806843334657 2023-01-21 09:14:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When I was in SZ, I also remember some companies and hotels would put tangerine bushes in their lobby during CNY (that they don't eat).  Is that a SZ thing, a Guangdong thing, a South China thing, or what? Can't recall seeing it in other places I've lived.  https://t.co/VZSXDrr70d
1616725802003107840 2023-01-21 09:14:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some sources I found say eating citrus at CNY dates back to Song.  Supposedly cause tangerine Ê°î/Ê©ò and auspicious Âêâ are homophones (in Canto at least, probably other regional languages too. Not Mando.)  Most of China is cold during CNY, so this had to have been a South thing.
1616725795921358849 2023-01-21 09:14:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We went out last night on a special trip just to buy fruit for the new year. Hit up several fruit stores and a wholesale fruit market on the outskirts of town to find the best product.  The CNY tradition of eating citrus, especially tangerines, is very strong here. üßµ  https://t.co/lB3oKI24ca

1616684326493786112 2023-01-21 06:29:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Anecdotally, I've always felt that it was a pretty close 50/50 split between men and women in Chinese 101 classes and the general population of those who come to China to work and study, but over time, more women ended up repatriating sooner and more men stayed for longer.

1616072424231170048 2023-01-19 13:57:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I wish I could say this kind of behavior makes them look bad, exposes them as biased or ignorant or mean, drives their audience away.  But I'm not sure that's actually true. I worry that instead, they are driving the window of reasonable discourse farther towards extremism.
1616072415993540611 2023-01-19 13:57:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mind you, I see it as belonging to the same class of behavior as those extremely online people writing 20-tweet rants about how cooking chili for your neighbors is ableism or whatever.

1616072410335444993 2023-01-19 13:57:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I worry these pundits are driving a shift in the Overton window of how you're "allowed" to talk about China.  Over a few years, their views have gotten more extreme and more emotional, that we're now at the point where such a benign op-ed is appropriate fodder for a meltdown?
1616072407315517440 2023-01-19 13:57:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But losing your shit over this (pretty harmless and hardly na√Øve) opinion piece on author's perceived tradeoffs and overall net positive of sending kids to school in China is bizarre and really poorly-adjusted behavior.  And this has been getting worse over the last few years.
1616072403813289988 2023-01-19 13:57:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's been clear for a while that certain pundits have made being outraged about China their entire identity.  The object of their outrage doesn't even have to be overtly pro-China; just being insufficiently critical is deeply and emotionally offensive to them.

1615589794851196930 2023-01-18 05:59:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @morrislolly Particularly someone like you would benefit most from more people exposing the Western propaganda in your life. You already know Chinese propaganda has distortions; you don't need me or anyone else to call that out for you (unless you were pursuing catharsis, not accuracy).
1615588727287603200 2023-01-18 05:55:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @morrislolly By contrast a lot more people take Western propaganda literally and at face value, and plus there's a lot more of it. I feel that exposing their misinformed and bad takes has a better chance of moving the needle on public perception more, moving it closer to reality.
1615588591102734337 2023-01-18 05:55:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @morrislolly I do follow a few propagandists and I do occasionally, (not often) call them out when I feel the distortion is too egregious. But I'd prefer to just ignore, because me yelling at state media has zero impact at all in terms of changing the discourse. Surely you know that too.

1615251302879199233 2023-01-17 07:34:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Which is a shame because as a layperson, it seems pretty important to me, and worth hearing the opinions on What It Means from people who have been thinking about this for longer than 24 hours.
1615250759507116033 2023-01-17 07:32:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To be sure, there are undoubtedly a few specialists on this very topic out there worth listening to, but they'll be impossible to find because they'll be lost in a sea of manure from the likes of Noah Smith, Ian Bremmer, and some dork from the Atlantic Council.
1615250232878718976 2023-01-17 07:30:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, "Chinese demographic crisis owing to ABC will lead to catastrophic XYZ" is going to be the hottest topic in clown land tomorrow, yeah?

Right now the map I saw indicated a HSR link to Nantong from there, but it wasn't clear how the connection from e.g. Suzhou or Hangzhou would work.
1614522585240473601 2023-01-15 07:19:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JRUrbaneNetwork @MarcoMonroyRob So perhaps something more like the Jinshan Railway then?

1614497391889231874 2023-01-15 05:39:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This will be the 4th major train station in Shanghai (along with a bunch of smaller ones).  Supposedly there will also be a new dedicated metro link connecting Hongqiao Hub to South Station to Zhuqiao Hub, (Shanghai East Station) all part of Shanghai Metro Phase 3.  https://t.co/75IikeuQAo
1614497329859678208 2023-01-15 05:38:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Previously some reports said it started construction at the end of 2021, but I think that meant just earthwork, site leveling, power connections, etc.  The Baidu map pin is currently still just a field.

1614268642497294342 2023-01-14 14:30:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *CORRECTION* @Jyves1994 heard about it first. I'm the worst.
1614268347746783233 2023-01-14 14:29:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Looking forward to sharing more of these kinds of mini-trips going forward, in between longer trips out to other provinces, now with much more competent media editing!  There's still so much to learn and discover, even about Shanghai, if you take the time to look for it. üßê
1614268341367209985 2023-01-14 14:28:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And @justinaforever edited together our day-trip to visit the trains into a mini-documentary here:   https://t.co/5q4QF57sRi

1614268332001341442 2023-01-14 14:28:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These trains have only been "discovered" by urban explorers in the last 2 years or so, supposedly already becoming a popular destination, but we didn't see any other tourists that day.  Probably the distance...it's really a pain to get out here. But worth it for the experience.
1614268326284496902 2023-01-14 14:28:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> People on Xiaohongshu speculate they were transported in as part of a planned venture that never took off like a train-themed hotel or park.  You've got to have some big connections to pull that off, since farmland development is sensitive and these are literally in a crop field.  https://t.co/yc4rW9Bwvh
1614268289634664449 2023-01-14 14:28:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We tried asking some elderly locals for details, but they didn't seem interested in chatting. One old man said they'd been there "a long time" and they had been transported in on "big trucks".  A truck like this is needed, but how did it navigate those small roads? A mystery...  https://t.co/XBXG2RWGXl
1614268260199038976 2023-01-14 14:28:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> All the train cars appeared to be part of a batch from Henan, judging from this booklet we found, and how the various routes they used to run all were destinations in Henan.  Looks like they were retired around early 2017 and transported here for...something. But what?  https://t.co/K6eIVVNrm8
1614268222475472899 2023-01-14 14:28:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Today, these trains are in bad shape.

But there's still many routes using these, and the cars still in use have been upgraded accordingly. This one had free WiFi before its retirement.  https://t.co/Pr59NiZFGD
1614268159967768576 2023-01-14 14:28:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These are still used in T/K trains now - slower than HSR, but much more affordable.  Each sleeper compartment puts you together with a few strangers, giving an opportunity to chat with a different socioeconomic stratum of China, as you leisurely roll through the countryside.  https://t.co/qM6fEUavBw
1614268132335714305 2023-01-14 14:28:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Walking into the creaking empty train cars, we found they were all sleeper cars, a combination of hard sleeper (3 tiers) and soft sleeper (2 tiers). There were 10 in total.  I took these trains quite a lot when I was a student but it's been years now since I've taken one.  https://t.co/CUhJTvzIps

A very power-hungry radiator indeed!  https://t.co/qOuqW3WvTr

1613147024718954497 2023-01-11 12:13:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To be sure I was actually a bit surprised to see this in Shanghai. It's definitely more uncommon to see these kinds of knockoffs these days in the bigger cities compared to the past (or the countryside)

1613123784554475520 2023-01-11 10:40:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ddshowerthink Yeah I thought about that too, but nothing really extreme happened to SH commercial power prices in December that would have stuck out and caused such a big MoM change...
1613113088701788161 2023-01-11 09:58:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And in their defense, it's not the easiest thing to understand, especially if you're trying to break down a power invoice with no background sector knowledge.  Honestly, this is my job and I still got something wrong in the first take (which is why I deleted). üòÖ
1613113084947881989 2023-01-11 09:58:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway I saw a lot of complaints on Weibo about how the grid company was ‰π±Êî∂Ë¥π.  I think the reality is that most people here don't ever really think about their power bills or pay attention to how they're calculated because they're usually too cheap to worry about.
1613113081210757121 2023-01-11 09:58:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So something odd is going on there. My power bill went from 200 to 900 CNY month-on-month, and I think that's pretty normal, using an AC and a space heater. I'm probably still in Tier 2.  This girl's case is extreme - maybe someone is tapping her power?  https://t.co/c27QO56XVq
1613113077368754177 2023-01-11 09:58:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For contrast, I even asked someone in China with a MUCH higher-than-normal power usage, maker @RealSexyCyborg, how much her power bills are, for a house full of industrial equipment...  ...and it's not even close (SZ power prices similar to SH)   https://t.co/OCJZOb2sG3
1613113073136701445 2023-01-11 09:58:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But that still doesn't really explain how the girl in the video ended up paying 3481 CNY last month. That's insane.  Even at Tier 3 pricing (no Time of Use) that implies she consumed 3,769 kWh in one month.  She mining crypto or something?  https://t.co/NnqV3US64l
1613113067721879554 2023-01-11 09:58:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For example, if you have a 1000W AC that you run all day long, (24h) then you're consuming ~24 kWh of power from that AC daily.  If you're in SH Tier 2 Pricing, that'll cost you around 14 CNY/day.  In SH Tier 3 Pricing, that'll cost 22 CNY/day.  For that one appliance.
1613113064018284544 2023-01-11 09:58:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anything that creates heat has a high power draw. So AC, hot water heater, coffeemaker, water kettle, hair dryer, clothes dryer, and especially the electric oven.  You can estimate your daily household power usage by calculating wattage * hours used and summing it all up.
1613113058817355778 2023-01-11 09:58:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Before 2022, it used to be from December 1 - November 30.  So in the past, the last month of the cycle was November, when it wasn't really that cold yet.  Now it's in December, when it's colder, so the heat demand is higher and the higher power bill really sticks out!
1613113055373832192 2023-01-11 09:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In 2022 for the first time, the calculation cycle for Price Tiers was set as Jan 1-Dec 31.  I guess what happened is many people crossed into Tier 3 pricing back around November, so their December bill was suddenly using the Tier 3 pricing, just as their heating power usage rose.
1613113050747502592 2023-01-11 09:58:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Honestly, it's not THAT expensive, compared to residential power users in, e.g., New York, or many places in Europe.  In China, residential power is cross-subsidized by commercial and industrial users, so we don't feel pain when fuel prices are high - they don't change at all.  https://t.co/6m4mTmlgzz
1613113031000723456 2023-01-11 09:58:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW, if your power supply is on SH's "Time of Use" system, you might also pay different prices, depending on whether you consume during peak or off-peak hours.  Power consumed during peak hours once you're in Tier 3 pricing costs 0.977 CNY/kWh (USD 14.3 cents).  https://t.co/lXjnr0BnrF
1613112997169500161 2023-01-11 09:58:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Notice how the price gap between the first tier and the second tier isn't that large - these are normal ranges for households to consume in terms of power.  It's the third tier where things get kind of expensive - 0.917 CNY/kWh (USD 13.5 cents).
1613112993637892102 2023-01-11 09:58:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, as you consume power throughout the year, you hit volume thresholds and power consumed thereafter becomes more expensive.  For annual usage between 0 and 3120 kWh, you pay 0.617 CNY/kWh.  Between 3120 and 4800 kWh, you pay 0.667 CNY/kWh.
1613112988579565568 2023-01-11 09:58:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The main thing that causes power bill fluctuations for residential power users in China is which Price Tier you're in.  You start in Tier 1 and your Price Tier rises according to how much you consume. There are 3 Tiers total.  These are the Shanghai tiers:  https://t.co/nEL8yH2JOj
1613112982111916032 2023-01-11 09:57:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay let's try this thread again! I deleted the previous attempt because it had bad info. Read this instead:  A lot of people were shocked by high power bills last month, especially in Shanghai.  I'll try to explain What's Going On, hopefully with good data this time. üßµ
1613029391910711296 2023-01-11 04:25:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Yeah that seems very possible, considering how even your power bill is still just half of what she claimed to have paid last month...
1613001420621615105 2023-01-11 02:34:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece Add in your electric hot water heater and your fridge and your coffeemaker and all the other power-consuming stuff and some of us are probably consuming 30-40kWh a day in the colder months.  We blow through Tier 1 and 2 price steps in no time.
1613000891254333441 2023-01-11 02:32:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece I think a lot of people are not used to actually thinking about how much power their appliances consume.  I've been leaving my 1000W AC on for at least 14 hours a day, plus a 1000W space heater for the other room.   That's 2000W x 14h = 28 kWh PER DAY just for heating.

1612782144782495745 2023-01-10 12:03:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realzoestrimpel @yuanyi_z If you were unaware, it's been a bit of a cultural trope and part of The Discourse on Twitter since 2021 when this post went slightly viral (of course the US was being referred to here, but the sentiment applies broadly across western media and punditry)  https://t.co/8OQcpdCThp
1612781512872845312 2023-01-10 12:00:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realzoestrimpel @yuanyi_z It's a tacky trope for western commentators to invoke Asia when describing what they see as malign behavior from their own gov'ts.  It keeps happening &amp; I think it should be called out, forcefully, every time it happens, until people feel uncomfortable reaching for the metaphor.

The big builders are all SOEs anyway - they build according to the national plan - or they're supposed to. But it seems for whatever reason the construction permits have been slow.
1612655955917012993 2023-01-10 03:41:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moylecroft A bit disappointing. Keep in mind CGN is just one of 4 developers. But it is the largest one.

I'm in a somewhat technical consulting field and it wouldn't make sense for our clients to hire full-time staff to hire what we do unless they're massive. They just wouldn't use those staff enough to justify their full-time salaries.
1612304031791345664 2023-01-09 04:23:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Theoretically, it's more cost-effective to pay a consulting firm for the collective knowledge of a team of people, rather than hire the same human resources internally, especially if you only needed one specific thing. But there are many different kinds of consultants too.

1609916750430375937 2023-01-02 14:17:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @feiduoli Because that's not even close to the most common argument used to defend these policies that I'm seeing (although I did mention it in the third tweet of that thread).  The most common argument I'm seeing to justify these policies is "well...doesn't China do the same thing?"
1609891476955365378 2023-01-02 12:36:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc I can't wait for all the apologies and admissions of contributing to exaggeration and hyperbole from the usual suspects. I'm sure they'll be coming any day now.
1609887714958282752 2023-01-02 12:21:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the spirit of full debate, here's a public-health based rationale for why testing requirements for China travelers could be useful (basically data collection).  Not a common argument, but a better one than "well they did it first".  h/t @Buhuifasheng   https://t.co/y0gTBXEClh
1609882236761047040 2023-01-02 12:00:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buhuifasheng That's the first logical argument I've seen in favor of a pre-departure test that seems to have a useful public health premise. Thanks for sharing it.
1609880098320322560 2023-01-02 11:51:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buhuifasheng ...so that's what formed my presumption that the scientific rationale was poor
1609879127691259904 2023-01-02 11:47:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buhuifasheng Yeah the WHO statement was disappointingly wishy-washy. Didn't condemn, didn't endorse, just said the concern is "reasonable".  Just about everyone else I'd seen on virology/epidemiology/infectious diseases/public health Twitter was pretty dismissive/critical.  A small sample:  https://t.co/S8nM3dE95P

1609861666560446465 2023-01-02 10:38:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buhuifasheng Should also still be the case. Do you think that's a reasonable policy?

1609841062063013889 2023-01-02 09:16:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm For sure. I think that's an accurate assessment of the policies overall: "it is illogical but that really does not matter because it is politically useful"  So then...the people still searching for a logic-based defense are left with nothing but bad options. üôÉ
1609838904089391104 2023-01-02 09:07:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mister_K_fomo I'm not complaining. I'm commenting on the nature of the debate  People trying to defend bad policies don't want to be seen as racist, so they have to find a different reason, but the other rhetorical approaches are bad too. They end up saying "No it's not racist, just stupid".
1609836943466196993 2023-01-02 09:00:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mister_K_fomo At the risk of sounding rude, I think you need to read my tweets again before commenting
1609836369886736385 2023-01-02 08:57:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm I agree it's all bad policy...I just think it's (darkly) funny and a little yikes that the best available defense is: "we're just holding ourselves to the same scientific standard as the place that just spent 3 years misting everyone with disinfectant"

1609114301075423232 2022-12-31 09:08:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course this twitter post from Nanjing last night showed an outcome seemingly much more similar to Chengdu...a little pushback and the passengers are sent home.   https://t.co/rZEjK040jA
1609113479126056960 2022-12-31 09:05:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meanwhile, Xi'an is having a bad PR day.

And this post from earlier today claiming a quarantine hotel is locking people in...  https://t.co/chBeIRfZaB

1609108329246359552 2022-12-31 08:44:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Final piece of Chengdu evidence. ~1 hour ago.  Weibo user says they just today took flight CX986 from HK to Chengdu, arriving to no quarantine restrictions whatsoever (0+0). They took a test on arrival, and then left the airport.  https://t.co/r6i4AH43dN
1609108316608946176 2022-12-31 08:44:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meanwhile this user said today they checked into their quarantine hotel last night in Chengdu, expecting 5 days, but were surprised to be notified this morning that they could leave immediately.  Looks like it it came apart in Chengdu basically overnight.  https://t.co/ijyh0GKoLt
1609108303820492800 2022-12-31 08:44:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This user says they arrived in Chengdu last night and went home directly.  A commenter asks "did they just let you go, or did you have to protest?"  They say: "The staff asked "Can you accept the outcomes of home quarantine?". And we all said 'Yes, we can.' Unity is important..."  https://t.co/WZ6PsoBNGu
1609108278012968961 2022-12-31 08:44:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Chengdu seems like it's the first city to completely give up on the inbound quarantine, in advance of the official date of the 8th. I grabbed a few posts from Weibo to make a thread of evidence and they seem fairly consistent:
1609096403837677575 2022-12-31 07:57:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @damienics Very fancy veg food. Also has 3 "Black Pearls" on Dianping I believe
1609095776902483968 2022-12-31 07:55:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @StarlingardCCCP @CurtExplores Well there's still the inbound quarantine for 8 days, unless you successfully fight it, or fly into chengdu, or one of the other increasingly commonly examples of quarantine porosity. But assuming you don't, then you're going to be testing a lot.
1609095243147935744 2022-12-31 07:52:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores I had originally booked my flight on ctrip and after changing dates twice and eventually cancelling the whole thing because of positive covid tests, the ctrip agent was able to use the positive test excuse to negotiate a 75% refund with the airline that I wasn't expecting at all.
1609093310077108224 2022-12-31 07:45:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores Well it IS a real worry. PCRs stay positive for ages. Mainland uses 35. So you could test negative before departure somewhere that uses a more lax standard like 30, and then test positive when you land.  Although frankly I don't even know what that would imply at this point. üôÑ
1609092797063368707 2022-12-31 07:43:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores *PCR not CPR lol
1609091310543327232 2022-12-31 07:37:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores I still had a Ct of 32 although my symptoms had been gone for ~3 weeks.  One week later, my Ct was still 37.  According to the Thai test manufacturer, these are both considered positive. In Hong Kong (which uses 30 as the threshold) neither would be considered positive.
1609090388589174787 2022-12-31 07:33:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores China specifically requires a CPR with a Ct count of &gt;35 to be considered negative.  The standard of Ct used to determine positivity varies by test manufacturer and country. For instance, the ones in Thailand use 40 as their threshold, which is stricter than what China uses.
1609037131305078787 2022-12-31 04:02:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JRUrbaneNetwork Bummer. But also good anyway.

1608749711888109569 2022-12-30 08:59:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 Interesting...I wonder if it's happening right now on other inbound flights that didn't happen to have someone to document it.   Not seeing anyone talking about it on Weibo anyway... Although it could have been posted and removed.

1608679222251499520 2022-12-30 04:19:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 This is like the the horseshoe idea of "government documents are an abstruse mystery understood only by expert Party whisperers".  Either they're pathetically justifying why they don't need to learn Chinese, or, once they do, claiming no one else can do it like they can.
1608677321778810882 2022-12-30 04:12:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 We are NOT past the "stereotype" that language skills are a prerequisite for "understanding China."

Oz coal ban was a full year prior to the power shortages - the small imports had already been long-replaced by Indonesian coal.

1607013352710238209 2022-12-25 14:00:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg Cajun food, despite being itself being a mishmash of other cuisines, is both large enough to constitute its own cuisine family and unique enough to be its own thing, so that's what I normally point to.
1607004706458722306 2022-12-25 13:25:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TamParanch I'll take a look at that Carrefour sometime...Pudong is like a different country for me.  The Cityshop at Shanghai Centre (the one you mentioned under the Portman Ritz) didn't have it when I went yesterday. Nor did Ol√© or any of the 4 little import stores I visited in Jing'an.
1607003966185046019 2022-12-25 13:22:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 It's so much better here now that this deeply embarrassing generation of laowai have mostly left.  It was already happening before covid, but the last three years have definitely accelerated it.
1606639401089781760 2022-12-24 13:14:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TMK_TinaManiK Kicking myself for not bringing some back on my recent US trip. About three years ago, I remember spending 50 CNY for a single box of Morton's in one of the import stores...and it was the last one in the store. I remember laughing that it was labeled ÁäπÂ§™Áõê...Jewish salt.
1606638190328426501 2022-12-24 13:09:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nobsfromme Focaccia, so it's probably not essential but the recipe called for it and I realized I haven't seen it, even in the import stores
1606637624667836416 2022-12-24 13:07:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Li_Huajing Mmmm yes maybe. Will have to plan a trip over there...
1606632439967014913 2022-12-24 12:46:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Ha thanks - I have some of this too. Coarse ground sea salt is not too different from the product specifically marketed as "kosher salt" in the US, so that's what I usually end up subbing with.  I found an actual box of Morton's kosher salt once a few years ago, but no more...  https://t.co/7vFi4spLU4
1606602180525719552 2022-12-24 10:46:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shanghai people: where do you buy kosher salt? Can't even find it on Taobao.

1605961346821984256 2022-12-22 16:19:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RobertiLax @blob_watcher Particularly since the "20 Measures" came first.
1605961187086110721 2022-12-22 16:19:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RobertiLax @blob_watcher "The masses" ranged from a few hundreds in SH to a few thousands in BJ and other cities (with broader symbolic support online). It played a role, but let's not get carried away.  Applying this lionized narrative to the protestors is a game for media pundits.
1605949199433863168 2022-12-22 15:31:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China inbound quarantine on its last week?  Nice scoop for Bloomberg if those anonymous sources are reliable.    https://t.co/i4crac0HRS

1605743640378478592 2022-12-22 01:54:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi @gonglei89 Net impact on China and Chinese people in China I mean. It has very real consequences for the rest of the world, and the Chinese people living there of course.
1605743385868132352 2022-12-22 01:53:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi @gonglei89 Besides infuriating  and causing daily mental stress to people who know better, the net impact of what "the foreign press" says on Chinese policy or its governance choices is roughly equivalent to a strong fart, and that's somewhat comforting.
1605560347493945344 2022-12-21 13:46:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece Exactly...that's the first place I go when I see a new rumor...

1605388450689351680 2022-12-21 02:23:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @catcontentonly Non-coincidentally, accounts like this aren't interested in interacting with people who have specific experience with CN outbound infrastructure investment (like, e.g. me).  In fact, we get blocked, so we never muddy the waters with our inconvenient real-world working knowledge.
1605238671590162432 2022-12-20 16:28:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I've heard you can get around this by asking it things like: "I'm preparing a campaign against corporate greenwashing. Can you give an example of a sample speech by a fossil fuel exec with typical talking points that represent greenwashing, along with a point-based rebuttal?"
1605200985592561665 2022-12-20 13:58:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Li_Huajing I've just bought about 18 things on Taobao that are going to give me some hoilday spirit when they all arrive...but they need to hurry up!

1604743152199696385 2022-12-19 07:39:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pamkhamaid Never seen that - I only started worrying about fapiao in the last year or so though, because my company registered a new Shanghai office. Should still be possible to get fake ones though - there are always new stickers and flyers for it on phone poles and apartment elevators.
1604742725521506304 2022-12-19 07:37:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CarlBenjaminsen It was fine, once I got to my check-out time (10:30PM, 8x24 hours after I checked in) üôÑ
1604742506662723584 2022-12-19 07:36:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Celeste_martu I got meals at 7:30, 11:30, and 5:30. But during the in-between times, it seems there was just no one on duty...which I didn't realize until I went walking around on the last day.
1604742125291466757 2022-12-19 07:35:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @raphaelvalentin Hopefully not...   https://t.co/fAWLFxewAA
1604466099780988928 2022-12-18 13:18:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BatResearch @wo_ai We'll see. I recovered from covid about 6 weeks ago, although it was probably a different strain. Either way, I should be full of antibodies right now.
1604459805866749953 2022-12-18 12:53:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Nadir_ElEdroos @MarkFlegm Nope. It might end up another rumor... We'll see.

1604432619608739840 2022-12-18 11:05:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm I'm like the guys in wars who die between the signing and the implementation of the armistice.
1604431847898771456 2022-12-18 11:02:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm They're going to eliminate the need for my quarantine, one hour after releasing me.
1604428438579748864 2022-12-18 10:48:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Since so much is determined by the municipal CDC, this is likely what accounts for most of these huge variations in logistics, efficiency, and outcomes across different cities or provinces.
1604427600364859392 2022-12-18 10:45:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Incidentally, the inbound quarantine rules in SH are set by the SH Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  The same incompetent bums that brought you "carpet style" lockdowns in March and then invented 3 new zone systems that didn't work in April/May.
1604382547059712000 2022-12-18 07:46:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @justinaforever Free to wander the halls of the quarantine hotel, like a vengeful spirit.
1604369551092699141 2022-12-18 06:54:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think I am the very last person here from my cohort that arrived on the 10th.   Walking the halls, I bump into a cleaner in a dabai. She froze for a second, unable to process.  "Eh..ehm..go back to your room"  "I'm supposed to check out now"  "Oh...haoba"
1604369546160525312 2022-12-18 06:54:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Facing east, the windows are cleaner and we get a better picture of Shanghai Train Station and plaza to which the hotel belongs.  https://t.co/e0FBUw3hQN
1604369491588427776 2022-12-18 06:54:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Facing west. Air isn't actually that bad today...But the outside windows haven't been washed for three years.  https://t.co/IOP1SGL1gS
1604369471518298112 2022-12-18 06:54:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The hallways have seen better days. This is my first quarantine where the hotel didn't put plastic wrap down on the floor. I think they're gonna have to replace all the carpets.  There's also some lights burnt out/flickering, so it's very zombie movie-esque.  https://t.co/z1iRiFLSNQ
1604369434998583296 2022-12-18 06:54:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Additionally, every flat surface is covered with this accumulated white residue that I think is leftover from the spray?  https://t.co/DJuuADEUmm
1604369399288197126 2022-12-18 06:54:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Everything glass or metal in the lobby or hallways is severely pitted or corroded from the disinfecting mist that has been sprayed everywhere for three years straight.  https://t.co/SR1y4JNrqb
1604369375871795205 2022-12-18 06:54:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The lobby is a zero covid staging area. Gloves, swabs, guests lists, and of course, disinfectant bottles...  https://t.co/0Wm6tLW2ON
1604369353373126656 2022-12-18 06:53:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Decided to go down to the front desk and argue about my release time and discovered...no one home.  Thought about just... leaving. But I need the fapiao.  But since it seems no one is paying attention to me, I decided to take some pictures.  https://t.co/teBkLy90ap
1604303848482672645 2022-12-18 02:33:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Scholars_Stage Yeah, I get that. But this post did get me some suggestions for new follows that are indeed posting about neat China stuff I'm interested in, (and not covid) so it turns out maybe I just need to follow more people.
1604178524184936448 2022-12-17 18:15:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ShenzhenCity Sure. Looks like stuff I like üòÄ
1604075801888296960 2022-12-17 11:27:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @caspianshanghai Yeah, I think that was a shocking discovery for a lot of people (sure was for me).  Compared to Shenzhen, Shanghai's execution of policy felt incredibly sloppy.
1604075349931085824 2022-12-17 11:25:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @red_wallstreet hah! I guess her code will never change colors now, but it doesn't matter, since no one is checking?
1604070973246164992 2022-12-17 11:08:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Truly a very poor showing from the Shanghai authorities here, all around.  Compared to my previous week-long quarantines in Shenzhen and Changsha, Shanghai gets the big loser prize for being the most wasteful and illogical.  (Shenzhen is the winner by the way).
1604068701275553792 2022-12-17 10:59:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> No calls or contact today. Looks like that's the end of the story...  Also, the hotel told me I MUST stay at the hotel until I have completed 24hrs x 8 days. Not an hour earlier. Which means I have to stay until 11pm tomorrow.  Today was the last PCR test, mind you.
1604039406599303168 2022-12-17 09:02:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jynpang Hmmm. Maybe they should end up on my Thanksgiving dinner table
1604038014513975296 2022-12-17 08:57:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy I gotta follow more people outside of China Twitter. I have my energy circle, but that feels like work lol
1604037297439002625 2022-12-17 08:54:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zhangmeiqi18 Hey, whose alt is this?  New account that doesn't follow me, yet you oddly keep showing up on my TL to make slightly smug comments with a patronizing tone that you haven't earned.  I'm gonna block this account, but feel free to come back on your main profile and say hi.

1604004776119001088 2022-12-17 06:45:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @XianyangCB Yeah you've got this debate duration beat by like...2200 years?   I haven't read a word of any of that since my confucian classics course ten years ago...
1604002309587226624 2022-12-17 06:35:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (Not that it isn't important to talk about. Obviously it is. But it feels like Every Other Thing has been put on the back burner).
1604001271400517632 2022-12-17 06:31:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Gonna be honest...feeling some content fatigue from China Twitter right now.  For 3 weeks, it seems the only topic has been covid (with an occasional interlude so someone can rehash the protests and What They Meant) and I just want to know is anything else at all is going on?
1604000397659893761 2022-12-17 06:27:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buki_YGV I believe it
1603996561624555520 2022-12-17 06:12:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The Chinese turkeys are more expensive than the imported ones were, but probably will taste better?Since they'll be fresh (not frozen). I dunno, I've never had one.  Also they probably won't have their weight padded with saline solution...   https://t.co/z5Cw0DuuXf
1603996394590650368 2022-12-17 06:11:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Literally if you search for "imported turkey" on Taobao, all you get is results for fancy cat food.  Were frozen turkeys a victim of the cold chain covid import restrictions?  https://t.co/JNsXF2sPKc
1603996378887487488 2022-12-17 06:11:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Taobao used to have lots of frozen turkeys this time of year, imported from the US, Chile, or Poland.  This year, all the imported frozen turkeys are gone and all the vendors I've used before have Chinese turkeys instead, which I didn't even know was an industry here.  https://t.co/zQGMVpBWFS

1603656188976955392 2022-12-16 07:40:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CurtExplores @thisischaniece Well, the original tweet was posted by someone with like 40k followers and RTed by the author with her 80k followers, but has gotten a grand total of...11 likes so far.  So I think the take was perceived to be a little too silly for people to get behind, even for China Twitter.
1603652246180270080 2022-12-16 07:24:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece I've made the mistake of calling this one a journalist before and had it pointed out that she's actually a columnist,* so she has no mandate to be unbiased.  *Which apparently means someone whose opinions are so insightful that they get a full-time gig to share them üôÑ
1603638475592384512 2022-12-16 06:29:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Got a phone call a minute ago from the Jing'an level to confirm which shequ (neighborhood) I belong to within my sub-district.

1603610207162339333 2022-12-16 04:37:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yakov333 I think you should learn to respect what your family members think and appreciate their experiences, instead of thinking you're better than they are and condescending them by calling them brainwashed.  Like I said, I have no respect for that.  This conversation is done.
1603605717889318912 2022-12-16 04:19:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yakov333 I'm just wondering why you have so little respect for your family members and their experiences and feelings.  Maybe people in the USA or Europe respect that you insult your family. I don't.  It doesn't make you sound like an open or free thinker - just condescending.
1603603070939586561 2022-12-16 04:09:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yakov333 Maybe you're the one that's been mentally tortured and brainwashed?
1603596257875746818 2022-12-16 03:41:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Translation:  Me: So, do you prefer the previous anti-covid strategy, or the current one?  Friend: The previous one. I was already used to it I've realized the country (gov't) protected us for so long I'm a little guilty I used to complain a lot  JOURNALISM. BOOM.
1603595112952791041 2022-12-16 03:37:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> See, in 5 minutes I was able to find a friend who basically unprompted expressed the exact opposite sentiment about the ZC policy change and the government's role.  Should I write a column about it?  You see how ridiculous and invalid this whole approach is?  https://t.co/8faPAHzymn
1603587781602643968 2022-12-16 03:08:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Relatedly - I hold no illusions that what my Chinese friends think are a representative sample of a country of 1.4B people.  Or that what they tell me is viable material for a column about public sentiment in China.   https://t.co/noEvqagV1S
1603587778662453248 2022-12-16 03:08:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have friends with a variety of opinions on ZC and the easing of the policies, but none of them talk like this. Even when critical, their perspectives are more nuanced and circumspect.  If I became a NYT columnist, would my friends morph into liberal sound-bite generators?

1603349593466761217 2022-12-15 11:21:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I finally got through to the 12345 operator and filed a formal complaint against the sub-district. It's got an official case number and everything.  We'll see how it goes. At this point, I'm more curious about how the system works (or doesn't work) than I am about the outcome.
1603334323499040770 2022-12-15 10:21:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @donweinland Yeah, my neighbors wanted to know why I'm eager to come back at all...  If the quarantine hotel wasn't right over the train station...and if I could order delivery...it wouldn't be nearly as annoying.
1603315009563815938 2022-12-15 09:04:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina @TeslaChinaRider @manyapan That being said, my wife had a recent booster of Sinovac, I had only 2 of Sinopharm and we had  unpleasant-but-not-intolerable symptoms of essentially identical severity for about 3 days.  So anecdotes are...inconclusive as always.
1603314026905493504 2022-12-15 09:00:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina @TeslaChinaRider @manyapan Yeah from what I've seen of literature on the subject, boosters after 6-8 months are needed, regardless of which vaccine.  I'd bet the numbers for those who have a sufficiently recent booster to be getting the full benefit from it are pretty low.
1603303529573412864 2022-12-15 08:18:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhongguoxin88 Yeah no reason to think otherwise
1603298678118440960 2022-12-15 07:59:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most people in my quarantine group of 54 (Jing'an District, arrived on 10th) have been leaving throughout the day, as the transportation sent by their local committee arrives.  I'd say &lt;10 left. A few people like me were rejected, and a few more didn't even apply.
1603297158249484288 2022-12-15 07:53:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Update - no luck. The problem is definitely at the sub-district level, and they don't seem to fear repercussions, so they must believe they have a good excuse.  The 12345 hotline is so overwhelmed right now that you can't even get in - it just says "system too busy" and hangs up.

When I couldn't leave BKK, the airline didn't want to refund me a cent, but the Ctrip agent got on it and got the airline to refund more than 75% of my ticket.
1602948308191715328 2022-12-14 08:47:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @coach_samuelT @EricFixmer I was in TH too when I tested positive. Because TH uses a VERY strict standard for positivity (Ct&gt;40) I was positive on the PCR test for one month straight, all from the same infection.  I started to wonder if that accounted for some accounts of fast "reinfection" I'd heard of.
1602937290606620672 2022-12-14 08:03:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EricFixmer Yeah actually they were really hoping I'd appreciate that there's cases in the building and I'd want to stay away. But I was like...well to be honest, I had it about 6 weeks ago and recovered now. Sooo thanks but no thanks. Let me go home.
1602936130755698688 2022-12-14 07:58:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jeffrey_WH Yeah...or more likely some crank at the sub-district level, since it seems everyone from my sub-district is getting the same treatment   https://t.co/T2o2Q4CTNc
1602920523842965504 2022-12-14 06:56:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DebSeligsohn BTW my quarantine last year in Shenzhen while I was living there ended with me successfully negotiating a home quarantine for the second half despite a similar wall of BS (at the time it was 7+7).  I'm getting lots of practice in...lol   https://t.co/uLFUvW8ek2
1602918895827951616 2022-12-14 06:50:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DebSeligsohn The explanation we got in the Kunming case was "you can't do the 5 and 3 in different cities". Citing the need for a plane or train ride in-between, which would break the closed loop.  I can at least appreciate that logic, which led to my improved expectations for Shanghai.
1602917581119115265 2022-12-14 06:45:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent It's this artifact of the inbound quarantine system being left fully in place, while the domestic anti-covid systems were gutted. There's way more covid out there right now than in this hotel, that's for sure!
1602917191518605312 2022-12-14 06:43:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DebSeligsohn Yeah, my wife last month too, who had to do a full 8 in Kunming before returning to Shanghai. But entering Shanghai directly you'd expect would be less exhausting on this point...
1602914796252278784 2022-12-14 06:34:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wo_ai They have the authority to evaluate whether my home "Á¨¶ÂêàÂ±ÖÂÆ∂Êù°‰ª∂" or not. Their response didn't have anything to do with my apartment, so I knew they just made it up.
1602914355330195456 2022-12-14 06:32:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent If possible, I'd like to maintain the generally congenial relationship I have with the local committee people from being a volunteer and group buy leader during the lockdown.  I'd like to think I'm getting a tiny bit extra consideration for that right now. We'll see...
1602913626246901760 2022-12-14 06:29:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lukegilesADL I learned from the show Suits that "threat of sanctions is better than filing for sanctions".  Let's see if the logic works for 12345 lol
1602912374020661248 2022-12-14 06:24:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joan_poh Thanks! (deleted the last tweet to edit a typo)
1602912258899820546 2022-12-14 06:23:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Funnily enough, the lockdown in SH made me way more aware of the local gov't apparatus and the relationships/working methods and channels for recourse.  Ours seems to legitimately be fairly sensitive to complaints to the 12345 hotline, so I think there's a decent chance there.
1602910908405145603 2022-12-14 06:18:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have applied all the resources I can to add pressure to the local committee rep, who said she'll "talk to the secretary one more time".  I also hinted I'm very willing to call 12345 and make a ruckus.  Curious to see what'll happen. Squeaky wheel gets the grease, or gets ignored?
1602910904449871877 2022-12-14 06:18:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But hotel told me that no one from my sub-district has been been accepted for a while, so the rogue actors are at the sub-district level.  Other people people in my group have gotten their notices to go home tomorrow. Some just a few streets away (in different sub-district).
1602910901698547712 2022-12-14 06:18:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's no good reason for making me stay in the hotel, of course. They just ÊÄïÈ∫ªÁÉ¶, don't want the trouble.  They just made up some excuses, told me the community already has too many cases, they're too busy vaccinating people, etc. Ê≤°ËØùÊâæËØù  (I'm confirmed negative, mind you)
1602910897944625153 2022-12-14 06:18:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Tomorrow will conclude 5 days in the hotel quarantine in Shanghai, whereupon I'm supposed to be transferred to home quarantine.  My local committee is refusing to take me back. They want me to do the last 3 days in the hotel.  Which of course contravenes the 5+3 national policy.
1602894451566780417 2022-12-14 05:13:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Indeed, a much more useful proxy for assessing outbreak severity in the context of the current regulations
1602880899774746624 2022-12-14 04:19:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Off the top of your head, are you familiar with how GB2626-2019 was improved/enhanced/strengthened vs. GB19083-2010, which seems to the more common older standard? I see a lot of the older standard masks on Taobao.
1602853341364899841 2022-12-14 02:29:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think this is the thread where I've finally outed myself as being way nerdier than my followers
1602843601570263042 2022-12-14 01:51:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you don't understand what any of this means, check out my thread yesterday about Renewable Energy Certificates:   https://t.co/8BpviACDUC
1602843173612847105 2022-12-14 01:49:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course, if you're in the USA or Europe and you demand proximity/additionality of the green power, you're SoL, since these projects are all in China.  And it's not going to change what's actually coming out of your outlet. But that can still be ok:   https://t.co/dzz3XXX1l6
1602843162812514304 2022-12-14 01:49:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The average American uses 4-5 MWh of power in their home/year (average household uses around 11 MWh according to the EIA).  Each one of these represents 1MWh, so for 250 CNY (36 USD), you could "offset" your personal power consumption, just like the big corporations do.
1602843146102378496 2022-12-14 01:49:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This holiday season, give your loved ones the gift of energy - Chinese green energy!*  Anyone can buy a Chinese renewable energy certificate; it's not just for corporate buyers.  See listings at:  https://t.co/C169gw1M3H  *energy not included  https://t.co/nvkv1H7H8U
1602701685688000515 2022-12-13 16:27:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AKgnewsbee Green Energy Certificate. It's not very creative üòÑ
1602662610046160896 2022-12-13 13:51:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After all, at the end of the day, as a company you paid a premium, a green generator somewhere got paid, and the market as a whole nudged slightly towards more low-carbon power.  Your purchase allowed that to happen, and isn't that what you wanted?  End.
1602662605042388992 2022-12-13 13:51:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, a direct physical contract for delivery of green power (a Green PPA) is always best if you can negotiate one.   But if your region doesn't have that, I don't see any problem with using unbundled RECs.  (Of course, those RECs had better be rock-solid like China's).
1602662601347182593 2022-12-13 13:51:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now maybe you still don't like the idea of a company buying green certificates and claiming they are low-carbon while actually consuming brown power. I get it.   But remember, lots of countries and regions just don't have enough (or any) local green power for companies to buy.
1602662597404549120 2022-12-13 13:51:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even if you're a corporate buyer in, say, Zhejiang, and you buy unbundled GECs from a wind farm in Gansu, you know 100%:  A. The wind farm didn't get any premium for green power sold to the Gansu grid, and B. No one in Gansu is claiming they consumed that green power. It's yours.
1602662593243807744 2022-12-13 13:51:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now, with the new reforms to the Chinese GEC, it's really hard to see where a corporate buyer of green power trying to meet the requirements of RE100 or GHG Protocol, needs to be worried about double-counting/double compensation.  I hope these programs revise their stance soon.
1602662589414408192 2022-12-13 13:51:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For this reason, international programs like RE100, SBTi, or GHG Protocol generally wouldn't accept Chinese GECs before (ironic, because they accept quite a few other garbage certificates that they shouldn't accept either).  So corporate buyers generally stayed away.
1602662585622736896 2022-12-13 13:51:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is huge because back when POWER TRANSACTIONS were used to track RPS instead, a generator could sell power to the grid (where it would be counted towards the grid's RPS) AND sell an unbundled GEC for the same power to another buyer...  ...which is a form of double-counting!
1602662581910777858 2022-12-13 13:51:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> AND, as of last month, GECs are now the foundation of how CN entities maintain RPS compliance.  An end-user's compliance is determined by how many GECs they hold, while the the grid's compliance is determined by summing how many GECs their customers hold. This is huge.
1602662576021987328 2022-12-13 13:51:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China's NEW GEC, on the other hand, after recent reforms, is now the gold standard for REC schemes around the world IMO. üí™  Certificate trades are tracked on a tamper-resistant registry. They may only be traded once. They can't be issued to subsidized projects.
1602662572255477760 2022-12-13 13:51:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Previously, Chinese GECs were handed out to RE generators that had delayed subsidies. They were given out for free, sold at high prices, and probably double-compensated with subsidies and other certificates. They were absoluteüí©.  (but some na√Øve/desperate companies bought them)
1602662568560295936 2022-12-13 13:51:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But things have improved a lot in the last few years, because China launched Green Power Trading and Renewable Portfolio Scheme (RPS).  RPS-obligated entities need to consume a minimum of green power, so an instrument to prove this consumption was needed.  Enter the Chinese GEC.
1602662564701548550 2022-12-13 13:51:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As for proximity or additionality...forget about it. The only projects that had RECs to sell were wind/solar farms in Western CN (or large hydro, which has a large environmental impact and isn't desirable, usually).  Meanwhile, the buyers were in eastern CN, consuming coal power.
1602662560918294528 2022-12-13 13:51:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay, now let's talk about China specifically.  For many years in China, corporations that wanted to use green power only had a few options: build it yourself (like rooftop solar) or buy unbundled RECs from subsidized projects (which implies double-compensation). Not great.
1602662555327295489 2022-12-13 13:51:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some buyers will even demand "additionality". This condition means that the renewable project would not have been constructed were it not for the revenue derived from certificate sales.  The buyer wants to be able to say: "because of my green power demand, a wind farm was built".
1602662545806209025 2022-12-13 13:51:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So to avoid this, they have begun adding other requirements for the unbundled RECs they are willing to buy.   Usually some kind of geographic proximity is required (e.g. generated within the same grid).  Usually they want an audit to ensure the project isn't double-counting.
1602662542111039488 2022-12-13 13:51:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thankfully, most programs like RE100 don't accept these kinds of certificates anymore though...at least they're not supposed to.  And many corporations won't buy them either.  They are getting very sensitive to their PR image, and very keen to avoid accusations of "greenwashing".
1602662538373902339 2022-12-13 13:51:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even worse, those unbundled RECs might have been generated by a plant that already has plenty of compensation from local tariffs or subsidies, and so is willing to sell these unbundled RECs dirt-cheap.  So it's not even expensive to offset all of your coal power consumption. ü§™
1602662534657765377 2022-12-13 13:51:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This allows a power user who is currently consuming 100% coal-fired power to buy unbundled RECs generated by some low-carbon generator on the other side of the world and claim they have fully offset their coal power usage with certificates.  Now they're carbon neutral! Hooray!ü§î
1602662530727686144 2022-12-13 13:51:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An unbundled REC is the situation where the generator sells power to a customer, but creates certificates that are sold to anyone that wants to buy them, maybe in another province, another country, or even the other side of the world.  Many people don't like this.
1602662526860558336 2022-12-13 13:51:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The method I described above, where the REC is traded to the power buyer together with the power, is called a BUNDLED REC.  Bundled RECs are harder to double-count or double compensate, and they represent real green power consumption.  The big problem has been UNBUNDLED RECs.
1602662517985411072 2022-12-13 13:51:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This leads to one of the key issues for RECs: double counting.  There are MANY ways that green power can be double-counted or double-compensated when a REC scheme is poorly designed.üßê  A REC registry MUST have measures to prevent the same MWh of power from being counted twice.
1602662514197954560 2022-12-13 13:51:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now right away, we need to resolve some important issues:  If I bought the power and I received a REC, should I be able to sell that REC to someone else?  Ideally no. RECs should only be transferrable once. Otherwise, multiple users might be able to claim the same green power.
1602662510385324033 2022-12-13 13:51:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For this, we can use a REC, a digital certificate on a registry (in China it's on a blockchain).  The REC represents the power that I sold to you. As long as you hold the REC, you can prove that you bought the green power. This will make your ESG compliance and PR teams happy! üòç
1602662506165829632 2022-12-13 13:51:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> RECs are a type of tradable instrument that represent green power consumption.  The logic behind RECs is simple: A REC represents some low-carbon generation. If I generate  1 MWh of power from my wind farm and I sell the power to you, how do you prove you consumed that power?‚ö°Ô∏è

Unless you don't believe vaccines work? Happy to point you to recent data from Hong Kong if so.
1602200680768614400 2022-12-12 07:16:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlfonsoCosta99 I presented logical points that supported my conclusion, while you tried to argue that the POSSIBLE public health burden from bad ZC policies was worse than the KNOWN public health burden from original covid or Delta running amok in an unvaccinated population.
1602199455922819075 2022-12-12 07:11:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlfonsoCosta99 There IS ample evidence that that CN is in a better position now to be exposed to a outbreak than it would have been 3 years ago.  The evidence is epidemiological data on: 1. The efficacy of vaccines and 2. Relatively decreased omicron mortality.  Like I said in the thread.
1602174521288830979 2022-12-12 05:32:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi Choose your own adventure  https://t.co/ujD2TRtkDB

1602134789808873473 2022-12-12 02:54:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yjlu3 ZC didn't "return" after April. It was pretty much the same as before, applied more broadly because there were more outbreaks happening in more places.  It got noticed more after April, because one of those places was Shanghai.
1602132960094060544 2022-12-12 02:47:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlfonsoCosta99 We KNOW hundreds of thousands/millions died in other countries from covid.  We DON'T KNOW the total health burden of the side effects of ZC, but you're going to have to work to quantify it before anyone will accept that it's worse than millions dead.   https://t.co/CjM6CTIaaJ
1602131633645457408 2022-12-12 02:42:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @InternLon Having almost everyone get infected with omicron after getting vaccinated is a far more preferable than what other countries did. That's the whole point.   https://t.co/vvHZ4AdMwf
1602130819631710208 2022-12-12 02:38:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buki_YGV I focus on the three years because I'm responding a tweet where the guy specifically used a quote about three years.  If you want to write a different thread about a different topic, go right ahead.

They must always be seen as if they were a cartoonish Disney villain with no characteristics other than wanting power.  ZC - because they are evil end ZC - because they are weak and evil
1601896623701118979 2022-12-11 11:08:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere But we got this out of it:   https://t.co/KbpHw3i1NQ
1601895783129055233 2022-12-11 11:04:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelSchuman Hi Michael, thanks for the comment. I agree with the premise of that sentence.  Like I said further down the thread though, if the concessionary remark is buried in the piece, while the title and lede set a different tone and framing entirely, it's kind of a moot point.
1601895034475143170 2022-12-11 11:01:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Totally irrelevant to the thread, but I really wish I had written "aftermath...unfolds", instead of "aftermath...appears".  The appropriate collocation eluded me until just a minute after I hit "Tweet" and now it's going to drive me crazy.
1601891448538173440 2022-12-11 10:47:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *mortality, not morbidity üò≥
1601884509343191040 2022-12-11 10:20:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm not sure I'd even make that argument necessarily, because it still relies on hindsight, but at least it's a more coherent argument than "the last 3 years were wasted".  Which relies on sheer logical incompetency, both to write such a thing, and to approvingly quote it. üôÑ
1601884506184880128 2022-12-11 10:20:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If Omicron had mutated into something more mild by the end of 2022, then ZC in 2022 would have looked better in hindsight.  But it didn't, so 2022 ends up looking like a lot was spent for relatively little public health enhancement (say over the period of Feb 2022 to Dec 2022)
1601884502988828672 2022-12-11 10:20:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now, a smarter, more targeted piece might have asked:  "What has China gotten out of the last 9 months of burning national resources?"  Here, the public health return on investment is  smaller. Maybe bought time for a few extra points of higher vax rates? A few more hospitals?
1601884499788595200 2022-12-11 10:20:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And if you bury a mention of that super important fact halfway through your piece, instead of making it the headline and the lede, I'm sorry but you're just being obviously disingenuous.
1601884493132234757 2022-12-11 10:19:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They shifted the nature of China's exposure from completely unvaccinated and Delta, to mostly vaccinated and Omicron.  That's your return on investment to public health for the resources spent during that time.
1601884489911001088 2022-12-11 10:19:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So it's categorically false that China is exactly where it was three years ago. It's just false.  Now, people are vaccinated! Hospital capacity is expanded! Public health awareness is higher! Omicron morbidity much lower!   China's policies bought both public health and time.
1601884486425534464 2022-12-11 10:19:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hell, I'm CURRENTLY IN a silly, superfluous, inbound quarantine in SH, but that hasn't damaged my memory on how successful and effective the policies were during the most vulnerable time here 2020/21, pre-vaccines, before ANY medications were available, with more deadly strains.
1601884482415767553 2022-12-11 10:19:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As the inevitably ugly aftermath of the relaxed ZC appears, we're bound to see more astonishingly out-of-touch takes like this appear too.  I too, lived through the frustrating excesses of ZC in 2022, including a 2mo. lockdown...but I haven't forgotten 2020/21.

A pretty notable oversight, considering it creates this scenario where a confirmed positive person has less restrictions than a confirmed negative person.
1601832096267669505 2022-12-11 06:51:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @milestileuk Yeah, although I actually stayed for longer because I took the time to check in at the head office, meet some friends etc.
1601829295240138754 2022-12-11 06:40:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hankinbeijing Yep
1601828496241995776 2022-12-11 06:37:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our quarantine WeChat group is full of people complaining about how silly it is that people in the city who are confirmed positive now can self-isolate at home, while we, inbound travelers who have just tested negative THREE times, will be treated like lepers for the next 8 days.
1601826629533151233 2022-12-11 06:30:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Flying from Hong Kong, I had to take a negative test within 48 hours of flight, AND a test at the HK airport within 5-8 hours before my flight AND a test when I arrived in Shanghai.  The inbound traveler system is clearly still lagging the opening up for the rest of society.
1601826624973901829 2022-12-11 06:30:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's apparent that the different phases of the quarantine process are handled by three of four different units, with no logic coordination among them.  It's embarrassing frankly, to be so disorganized after so long doing this.
1601826619521310722 2022-12-11 06:30:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The arrival and check-in process was brutally inefficient. After YEARS of doing these inbound quarantines, you'd think the process would be streamlined a little more by now.  We arrived at the jet bridge at 6pm and didn't get checked into the hotel until 11:30.
1601826613238239232 2022-12-11 06:29:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sadly, unlike the quarantine hotel experience reported for other districts like Huangpu, the Jing'an quarantine hotel still doesn't allow deliveries.

It's been an exhausting and at times very stupid trip, and I'm very glad to be home.  Almost anyway....First is hotel quarantine.

1600477575251656706 2022-12-07 13:09:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crzygradstudent @abovetheclouds The Power Engineering article about the Xuzhou retrofit might have the specific details you're looking for.    https://t.co/ukZiBscuc7  Feng notes in the article I linked at the end that the retrofit for deep ramping results in a rise of coal consumption/kWh of about 70gce.  https://t.co/dzwNuBF59n

1600460413325701120 2022-12-07 12:01:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Thanks for reading and sharing Naomi :)
1600453207180062721 2022-12-07 11:32:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JorritGosens Added this note to a later tweet in order to avoid making that direct comparison (which still I managed to do once despite explicitly trying to not do!)   https://t.co/fAsuqNplkk
1600452896130490370 2022-12-07 11:31:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A correction:   *Thermal efficiency would be about 50% higher than the average level in the US (33% vs. 50%)  Direct comparison of average gce for US vs. China is hard, as the average weighted calorific value of the coal consumed in each country is different, and not defined.
1600450604442464256 2022-12-07 11:22:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JorritGosens Yes, for this reason I tried to take care to highlight both gce/kWh and thermal efficiency, wherever I could throughout the thread, where the disparity is still apparent.   However the Feng article I was citing focused mostly on gce/kWh in his calculations.
1600426230964453376 2022-12-07 09:45:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The Feng Weizhong + Mao Jianxiong article I have referenced throughout this thread is much more thorough, and can be found in the original Chinese at   https://t.co/kjDBQ6ewPM  English version here. Translation errors 100% mine:   https://t.co/cfvuh3qPNM
1600426226937888768 2022-12-07 09:45:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As for Feng Weizhong himself...what a cool guy.  The world owes so much to these super-dedicated obsessives, who spend their WHOLE lives trying to figure out how to get 10% more chips on a circuit board, or 10% more rice from an acre, or 10% more electricity from a chunk of coal.  https://t.co/mE8A6b8cq1
1600426219165880322 2022-12-07 09:45:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My personal inclination, or maybe it's just a hope, is that of all the options, nuclear will be in a very strong position to fill that role.  I would look for new Chinese nuclear plants to be explicitly designed for flexibility and ramping, the way the French fleet is used.
1600426212803112960 2022-12-07 09:45:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Very soon, China won't be able to build any more coal, but the battle for the flexibility market has just started.  Whether it's coal, nuclear, batteries, gas, or another thing that most cost-effectively provides the flexibility for the renewables...this is an open question.
1600426209527357440 2022-12-07 09:45:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China is still YEARS away from being able to leave behind the conventions of "baseload plants" and "peaking plants" for: "whatever is cheapest/low-carbon in the system right now is the right plant".  But these subtle improvements are part of that journey.
1600426203223326720 2022-12-07 09:45:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you consider the sheer volume of CO2 emissions that have been avoided by the efforts of the Chinese coal industry to improve efficiency, it's really no less of a climate accomplishment than what has been achieved by building wind or solar or nuclear.  https://t.co/XEAwa4lTCS
1600425787366453249 2022-12-07 09:43:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know a long thread about coal plants isn't exactly the sexiest topic for people who are used to hearing me talk about renewables or nuclear.  But the fact remains that coal is still the backbone of the Chinese generating fleet, and these upgrades are incredibly important.
1600425783130206208 2022-12-07 09:43:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But Feng and his team have gone way beyond that. In the case study cited in Xuzhou, the retrofit coal plant is now capable of ramping down to as low at 19% load, allowing it to use as little fuel as possible while it waits to ramp up (e.g. in the evening when solar goes away).  https://t.co/uYpbmTmGM3
1600425774720626688 2022-12-07 09:43:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But they can be retrofit. This is another area in which Feng and his team are leading China to lead the world.  New coal plants approved in CN these days already have to be designed to ramp down to as low as 30% load if needed, to be flexible generators.  https://t.co/7cO2iMrSxS
1600425770509570048 2022-12-07 09:43:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, this is the other way for a coal plant to make money. Feng says gas is too expensive, batteries are unsustainable, hydro is almost tapped out, so China must use coal for flexibility.  Ramping coal like this is not usually good for the plant if they weren't designed for it.  https://t.co/U3MQkr7H5d
1600425763186311169 2022-12-07 09:43:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The flex generator that comes online to follow the wind/solar isn't just earning money for power sold; it's also earning revenue in the ancillary services market for providing flexibility.  In China, the beneficiary of the flex service (the RE generator) compensates the supplier.
1600425755863044097 2022-12-07 09:43:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Feng specifically mentions in his piece how increasing penetration of renewables in China's grid is creating a growing market for flexible generation.  When the sun/wind goes away, something else needs to take its place, quickly. Pumped hydro or gas are most common worldwide.  https://t.co/Hact3mHUrW
1600425748309102593 2022-12-07 09:43:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The second solution I mentioned above was "try to find a different way to make money".  I am specifically referring to ramping of the plant's power level, so it may be used for flex generation.  This is not something coal plants normally do, but with retrofits, it's possible.
1600425741401075713 2022-12-07 09:43:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The 2020 Xuzhou retrofit cost ~50M USD.  I wonder how much they've saved on fuel in 2021-2022? They probably feel like geniuses.  So...that's the first way a plant can improve profitability - retrofit boilers, turbines, or generators to use less coal for the same power output.
1600425735759753216 2022-12-07 09:43:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And it's possible!  Power Technology mag did a great profile back in 2020 of the work Feng's team did on a coal plant in Xuzhou, retrofitting an older plant to achieve 43.5% efficiency, lowing its coal usage from 318gce/kWh to &lt;285 gce/kWh.   https://t.co/ukZiBscuc7
1600425731573829632 2022-12-07 09:43:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Feng says in his article that he sees little hope for coal prices to return to 1000 CNY/MT in the near future.  So while NEW Chinese coal plants with a mandated efficiency of at least 270 gce/kWh are likely okay from a profit perspective, older plants need retrofits.  https://t.co/owznnZ9rva
1600425721268416513 2022-12-07 09:43:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the new ultra supercritical Pingshan Phase II, they almost hit 50% efficiency (~246 gce/kWh), half the avg. level in the US, and a contender for most efficient plant in the world.  Feng has been gaining mainstream and industry accolades for this work since at least 2010.  https://t.co/NgwyYEtF6u
1600425711919325185 2022-12-07 09:43:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So a solution, from a technical perspective, is to build more advanced coal plants that can still be profitable even at higher coal price levels, because they don't need as much coal per unit of output.  Feng and his team are on the absolute cutting edge of what is possible here.
1600425707846631424 2022-12-07 09:43:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In China (or Japan) which operates a fleet of much newer and more efficient plants than the US, the average is much lower, closer to 300 gce/kWh.  But, as Feng Weizhong points out in his article, this is only barely good enough to cover costs when coal is 1200 CNY/ton.  https://t.co/DrbE89G6IZ
1600425699466436608 2022-12-07 09:43:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Another way to look at this, if you are specifically thinking about plant economics during times of expensive coal, is:  "How many grams of coal do we need to generate one kWh of electricity?"   In the US, the annual avg. is ~508 g/kWh (or 1.12 lbs/kWh)  https://t.co/yGauSoKFYU
1600425691979579392 2022-12-07 09:43:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When we talk about plant efficiency, we are asking, IN VERY BASIC TERMS:  "When we burn coal for power, how much electricity is created, vs how much energy potential the coal had in total?"  The US average coal plant efficiency is ~33%, typical for the global average.  https://t.co/PYFCggl6Bi
1600425685222580224 2022-12-07 09:43:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Feng has been in coal plants since he was sent to work at one at the age of 16 during the CR. He became GM of that plant by the age of 29, despite having only a primary school education.  Now he's the vice-chairman of SH Waigaoqiao Power Station, one of the most efficient in CN.
1600425680948572160 2022-12-07 09:43:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The picture in the tweet above is taken from a glowing AFR piece about Professor Feng from 2017, in which he is called the "Thomas Edison of China."  Back in the day, Feng was quite open to talking to foreign media. This profile on him is fascinating:   https://t.co/tbBr37iqmP
1600425675214950400 2022-12-07 09:43:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's where our star engineer comes in. Professor Feng Weizhong is one of the most well-respected coal plant efficiency experts in China and even in the world.  He co-authored the article in the China Power Management magazine that inspired me to write this thread.  https://t.co/cwrF7mpsKv
1600425665920372738 2022-12-07 09:43:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well, you can lobby for lower coal price benchmarks or higher power prices, but at the end of the day, that's up to the NDRC and NEA.  What you can do yourself as a coal generator is:  - Make sure your plant is as efficient as possible - Try to find a different way to make money
1600425654620917761 2022-12-07 09:43:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The situation is what people in the coal industry grimly summarize as: "the more you generate, the more you lose".   But just shutting off the plant and not generating isn't an option...not after what happened last year with the power outages.  What's a coal plant to do?
1600425648392404992 2022-12-07 09:43:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The (mostly state-owned) coal generators are being forced to shield industry (and thus, consumers of Chinese goods) from the true impact of the energy crisis.  They pass some small bits, but for the most part, they are just absorbing billions in losses.   https://t.co/12gCfI1q1x
1600425638384762881 2022-12-07 09:43:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not EVERY plant is losing money of course. e.g., inland plants closer to Chinese coal mines are more likely to be doing ok, since transport costs are lower.  But coastal plants are most likely in pain.  Huaneng by itself reported 3.9 billion CNY (565M USD) in losses over Q1-3.
1600425632701517824 2022-12-07 09:42:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay, so first, 2022 has been another miserable year for China's coal-fired power plants.  Coal prices aren't as crazy as they were last year, but still high. The power price cap is higher than it was last year, but still too low.  The losses for coal generators have been huge.
1600425628922425347 2022-12-07 09:42:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Throughout this piece, I will be referring frequently to a recent article published in China Power Management Magazine that did a deep dive on this topic.  If you want to skip my Twitter pop coverage of this topic and just read the (more technical) article, link's at the end.
1600425624291905538 2022-12-07 09:42:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How are the global energy crisis and massive development of renewables forcing Chinese coal plants to become the most advanced in the world?  (Also, the story of the brilliant engineer with no high school degree who is leading the effort)  A long thread. üßµ  https://t.co/7EOACjJUMZ
1600350129487171585 2022-12-07 04:42:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MartinSebena I spend all day trying to be polite to stupid replies I get on Twitter, but congratulations, you broke me.  You decided to "well actually" the definition of SLAVERY in the context of comparing it to A QR HEALTH CODE SYSTEM intended to promote public health what the actual fuck?
1600349348042530816 2022-12-07 04:39:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MartinSebena This is the dumbest "well actually" I think I've ever seen in my life.  How did you read that insane comment, my response to it, and decide that my comment was more problematic?
1600324959754399744 2022-12-07 03:02:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jerometenk After I finished it, I wanted to go on Twitter to say "why is no one talking about how Andor is so good?" but then I did a Twitter search and found lots of people are talking about it...just not people I follow.

1599970924627136517 2022-12-06 03:36:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @antonmalkin @jerometenk I think that's 90% for the 2 dose standard
1599797011917967360 2022-12-05 16:05:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jacobus33543604 Maybe don't try to tell me how to use or not use Twitter?
1599796383787388930 2022-12-05 16:02:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realmemes6 You think it's a coincidence?
1599782166460010501 2022-12-05 15:06:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am "unsurprised but approve".  With the caveat that this is clearly being executed in a decentralized way and it seems like some regions are oversteering.  I'd think this needs to be done carefully and scientifically, or we're going to see miserable results.
1599782162861281280 2022-12-05 15:06:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I ask because I'm really quite curious what people are thinking right now and am looking for some kind of sentiment barometer. RT!  I get your response might be more complex or nuanced than a 25-character limit poll answer. Pick whatever is closest and comment to explain further?
1599782157106708480 2022-12-05 15:06:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Poll:  After public displeasure with anti-covid policies reached a tipping point, inspiring protests in several cities last weekend, Chinese authorities have responded swiftly by relaxing covid policies in many (but not all) cities and provinces.  You found this outcome:
1599716015709257728 2022-12-05 10:43:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TheStalwart It started out so strongly  https://t.co/rf8rPZzVjo
1599681360104681472 2022-12-05 08:25:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @R_Mc_Lean Viewed as a whole, the consistent intellectual dishonesty of this man's body of work is breathtaking
1599668270067777536 2022-12-05 07:33:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelSchuman I'd love to know the article you'd write if it seemed like the protestors were being ignored. Maybe something like:  "In His Inability to Engage with Criticism, Xi Reveals his own Insecurities"  Or perhaps:  "Xi Flexes Authoritian Muscle, Brushes off Protests"
1599299635549724674 2022-12-04 07:08:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @attackedChris @miketzian @sarahplusone Also most carriers from BKK -&gt; mainland only have one or two flights a week. The cheap BKK -&gt; Kunming flight on Lucky Air only flies on Saturdays, for example.
1599299292422107136 2022-12-04 07:07:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @attackedChris @miketzian @sarahplusone One drawback is that you'll have to get a 24h negative PCR test in Bangkok to fly on to the mainland, which has to be registered and approved in a health code app managed by the Chinese embassy in Thailand.  The cheapest recognized test center is 1500 baht (300 CNY).
1599294774754050051 2022-12-04 06:49:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @miketzian @sarahplusone @attackedChris BKK --&gt; Kunming or Seoul --&gt; Yantai/Qingdao are by far the cheapest ways in that I've found.  HK flights to mainland very expensive, especially Shanghai. HKG --&gt; Ningbo is the cheapest I've seen...around 2500 CNY.  HKIA doesn't allow intl -&gt; mainland transfers. You have enter HK.
1599274173297459200 2022-12-04 05:27:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere @JurassicDunk @RodericDay @Jyves1994 @martjacques Oh hey Zichen. I'm pretty curious about your position here.  As someone who fairly frequently profiles poorly-researched or inappropriately-framed foreign articles on Pekingnology...are you just looking for more newsletter content? üòâ
1599273132841635841 2022-12-04 05:23:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 @Jyves1994 @martjacques It's like it has to be a passion project for the journo AND the editor, because feel-good pieces about China are both swimming against the general anti-China current, AND they probably aren't even good business for the newspaper.  I guess this is asking for too much.
1599272982098366464 2022-12-04 05:22:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 @Jyves1994 @martjacques I know you were asking rhetorically, but it's really depressing how I have to wrack my brains to try to recall one.  I'm realizing that even if there was an editor willing to publish one, that editor's boss would want to know how this is going to drive clicks for advertisers?
1599269660243144704 2022-12-04 05:09:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @JurassicDunk @Jyves1994 @martjacques It's not something I think about a lot, if you can believe that. You are way more in tune with the theory and labels and definitions and what Marxists must and mustn't believe.
1599268858141224964 2022-12-04 05:06:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @JurassicDunk @Jyves1994 @martjacques I used to generally be a liberal in college. I'm somewhere to the left of that now. I've certainly learned to dislike liberals anyway.  I know for sure where I stand on anti-imperialism and believe capitalism is fundamentally unjust. But I know there's more to Marxism than that.
1599265294224351234 2022-12-04 04:52:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @Jyves1994 @martjacques Yeah I recognize and appreciate that the playing field is severely tilted towards negative coverage at an editorial level. You may be right that more correspondents would just equal more bullshit.
1599263999690178560 2022-12-04 04:47:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JurassicDunk @RodericDay @Jyves1994 @martjacques Mmm probably yes to that too. But it's not like either option is great. Let them in, the zone is potentially flooded with bad reportage. Block them out, the bad reportage continues from somewhere else, with less accuracy. I do understand why CN chooses to approach it in this way.
1599259101305122816 2022-12-04 04:27:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @Jyves1994 @martjacques I am serious. Not many of them, of course, because the editorial mandate back in London or NYC or wherever is still broadly anti-China.  I believe this because I know the people personally who want to write such stories (and get shot down by editors).
1599257833492860929 2022-12-04 04:22:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 @martjacques Of course with the caveat that some of them are fundamentally incapable of producing humanizing stories about the Chinese people, because they don't really see them as human. *cough*  https://t.co/CLAv12kKYQ
1599256490359291904 2022-12-04 04:17:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pstAsiatech lol. And this is why the myth won't die. People at top levels believe it, and won't stop repeating it.
1599255936681799686 2022-12-04 04:15:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 @martjacques When all you have is one correspondent (or none) in-country, all you get coverage of is national security and trade/economic news.  All the opportunities for humanizing stories about people are lost.
1599252767776071680 2022-12-04 04:02:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @martjacques Sinophobia IS rampant but this is just a non-sequitur.  Among China-focused media people I speak to, including UK media, most would must rather be working on the ground, but aren't able to get a J visa.
1599234087730155521 2022-12-04 02:48:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kostyantyniv517 @MaryGao Yeah I've only ever lived in first and second-tier cities...BJ, SZ, SH, Nanjing, Suzhou.

1598660549470220289 2022-12-02 12:49:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At least for me, I've realized it's a big part of why I've so enjoyed traveling to smaller cities in China, interviewing anyone who will talk to me, and doing those threads or articles about whatever I discover.  Honestly can't wait to get back out there.  Happy weekend everyone.
1598660546576158720 2022-12-02 12:49:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Perhaps this is part of why China-studies people are so enamored with chatting to the ever-candid Beijing taxi drivers?  Consciously or maybe subconsciously, we know we're hearing something unambiguously fresh and representative of the laobaixing, straight from the mule's mouth.
1598660543489134593 2022-12-02 12:49:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mind you, that's definitely not to say the perspectives of Chinese cultural/socioeconomic elites are bad or invalid or something.  Their perspectives are true enough for them, no doubt. And they wield a lot of influence. But they are still a minority.
1598660540188221440 2022-12-02 12:49:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By the time some perspective or attitude or idea is transmitted from Chinese laobaixing, to Chinese elites, to Western China Hands, to Western media, in a international cross-language, cross-cultural, cross-class game of telephone, we're bound to end up with some...distortions.  https://t.co/mpkeWqrRY2
1598660532223250432 2022-12-02 12:49:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because it's way too easy to think you're super in touch with "mainstream" attitudes or perspectives in China on a certain issue, and have tons of data points to back it up  ...but your data points were all gathered via people representing a small demographic.  I've done it. üò≥
1598660529622745090 2022-12-02 12:49:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And while it's obviously super hard to avoid skewing toward elite perspectives if you aren't based in China, I'm barely doing much better, and I live here!  It's an awkward reality of the field that we can and should at least try to be aware of, even if there's no easy "fix".
1598660526598459393 2022-12-02 12:49:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But of course this skews my understanding of China and things in China in a certain way.  Even if I'm aware and try to adjust for this, I am bound to have picked up some totally distorted views or just have blind spots.  I'd be lying to myself or you to say otherwise.
1598660523507470337 2022-12-02 12:49:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That means ALL the other CN people I know in business, academia, politics, arts, journalism, etc. are cultural or socioeconomic elites in some way.  Honestly, I think it's normal and understandable, based on my career, my hobbies, my social circles. I'm not ashamed or anything.
1598660520709869568 2022-12-02 12:49:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (If you're non-Chinese and have cultivated a robust working-class Chinese friend circle, that's great. I know exceptions will always apply, and I'm happy for you. Please don't be smug in my mentions, thanks)
1598660517962600449 2022-12-02 12:49:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How many of your friends only speak Chinese, have never traveled abroad, have never used a VPN? (i.e. a normal, "median" Chinese lifestyle)  I'll tell you honestly for me: I have just ONE. After 10+ years of living here.  (I mean a real friend friend, not an acquaintance)
1598660515093688321 2022-12-02 12:49:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let me ask rhetorically:  For those of us in this sphere with many CN contacts...How many of your friends have a median Chinese education level? (i.e., only graduated from junior high)  How many of your friends make an average wage for their city? (in SH, that's 11.3k CNY/month)
1598660512057036800 2022-12-02 12:49:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One thing I'm really trying to be more cognizant of is how my Chinese friend circle is weighted towards socioeconomic or cultural elites, relative to the greater population.  I think it can really skew your perception and understanding of China issues.  Aüßµto explain:
1598169398250176512 2022-12-01 04:17:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung I think the latter. Just imagine him getting shouty on Twitter and getting all the details wrong.

1597770383406440448 2022-11-30 01:51:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Kind of how some people prefer watching college sports over professional sports, because it's less refined, less perfect, may provide more entertainment.

They generally (not always) play at faster time controls like 3mins, 1min, even 30 seconds on the clock. Very high paced, less time to recall "book moves". So less theory, more unexpected positions, more upsets, more entertaining.
1597769084632190976 2022-11-30 01:46:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung When a player is "in book" it means they're still playing optimal lines that they have memorized by studying with an engine. Top players try to get each other "out of book" as quickly as possible.
1597768770092572672 2022-11-30 01:45:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Yes for sure. In fact many players when prepping for a match will intentionally choose obscure openings that might be theoretically weaker from a "perfect play" perspective (aka sidelines), counting on their opponent being unfamiliar with the line and making a mistake.
1597767674834345984 2022-11-30 01:41:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung At which point they start actually playing chess, instead of playing theory.
1597767515098460160 2022-11-30 01:40:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Yes, although it's about memorizing hundreds of permutations so it's still a feat in itself. At some point, someone either makes a sub-optimal move that departs from the established theory of "correct play" or they reach a point that hasn't yet been analyze yet.
1597765563752644608 2022-11-30 01:32:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung In the classical days of chess, an opening might have been "solved" to a depth of 8 moves on each side, something like that. Now chess engines help craft theory to lay out an optimal move selection for both sides for 15 or 20 moves in some openings...
1597765017864404993 2022-11-30 01:30:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Pro and even strong amateur chess engines all train with chess engines now, which are much stronger than any human player, helping them understand both optimal moves in set openings and more optimal thematic moves even after the position has departed from a set opening.
1597584012624932864 2022-11-29 13:31:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @liqian_ren Oops got it wrong. It's "benevolent dictatorship"   https://t.co/DdwK9mMzpo

1597126022276997120 2022-11-28 07:11:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc Anyway I think it would be pretty tactically effective for authorities throw carrots to the people actually protesting and demanding change re: covid policies. Obviously that won't placate the protestors calling for other stuff. But they seem to be a much smaller group.
1597124628157460480 2022-11-28 07:05:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc It's possible some the actions were already in motion, but I think it's more likely that the spate of policy relaxations in various cities we've seen over the last few days is indeed related to the protests.

But in English, "simian" is a word by itself that means "monkey or ape" so this mountain name could be Simian Mountain, or Monkey Mountain.  Which would be very appropriate.

1596340392991281153 2022-11-26 03:09:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Went on the Space Commune podcast to rant a bit about electricity and China's development and energy culture wars. Give it a listen if you're into any of those things. üòÄ  And big thanks to @FoxGGreen and @alexspcm for the invite.

1596019170000269312 2022-11-25 05:53:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @niccijsmith You too Nicola.
1596015634629828609 2022-11-25 05:39:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @niccijsmith Indeed, It'd be great for your readers to contrast the article you were commenting on, with the actual content of your tweet.  I wouldn't be so confident they'd all agree that you summarized the article accurately. But hey, maybe that's just me.   https://t.co/jVzFsTPvOx
1596014851322966016 2022-11-25 05:36:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @niccijsmith Oh yes, I recommend everyone read the article actually, and decide for themselves whether your tweeted summary was accurate, or a mischaracterization of the article and situation.
1596010727726538754 2022-11-25 05:19:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @niccijsmith Also, Chinese labor disputes are happening pretty much all the time. Maybe not as large or well covered as this one, but they aren't rare, not by a long shot.
1596010395969277952 2022-11-25 05:18:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @niccijsmith Using the word "as" to link the two parts of your sentence is pretty slippery here, since the driving force behind the protests is a labor and contracting issue (which has been covered pretty comprehensively by plenty of foreign media as such).
1595927223281676290 2022-11-24 23:47:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina Yes thank goodness the political culture wars in the US are over such normal things now /s

1595713935801348096 2022-11-24 09:40:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @StochasticStat1 @liqian_ren I was thinking about that "they relied on Chinese vaccines, now they have outbreaks" headline.

1595668444233752576 2022-11-24 06:39:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geeblandi If OP said "the fact that BJ media are choosing to address the grocery shortage rumors and not the lockdown rumors is not a great sign" I would've readily agreed.
1595666945579573248 2022-11-24 06:33:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geeblandi It looks like a direct response to concerns about insufficient groceries in the stores. Similar scenarios have happened all year.  Some plausible rumor gets rolling on wechat, causes a localized panic, and then some local media have to do damage control.
1595664085584347138 2022-11-24 06:22:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geeblandi Funny, I coulda sworn we were talking about pictures of vegetables
1595632906634137600 2022-11-24 04:18:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc well at least there's eleme drivers out there...  I feel like if there was an ongoing replay of the April 2022 SH vegetable panic going on in Lanzhou or wherever, I'd be seeing ironic memes about it on wechat...
1595632292734857216 2022-11-24 04:15:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China In normal times, it would be one of those "my t-shirt about how there's no grocery shortage has raised a lot of questions already answered by my t-shirt" situations.  But considering there's a pandemic and already a lot of concern about groceries, it's pretty goddamn normal.
1595631737769713670 2022-11-24 04:13:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China I just want to know what he would have national media do instead. Not try to reassure consumers in some reverse psychology trick?  "if we DON'T feel the need to reassure consumers that there's ample supplies, it's a sign that there's enough" like wtf is that logic
1595625642359676928 2022-11-24 03:49:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc Have any other cities tried to replicate the disastrous "whole of society lockdown includes delivery drivers and other essential workers" approach that Shanghai tookÔºü
1595623036442804224 2022-11-24 03:39:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What would constitute a "good sign" then?  -Pictures of empty shelves? -No messaging at all?  All of those could have the same comment attached, that it's "not a good sign".  If your commentary is applicable to all the scenarios, then it's not insight, just random empty words.  https://t.co/xwczOBWi9W
1595604930773282821 2022-11-24 02:27:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @liqian_ren Is it really all because of that one awful piece from the NYT?
1595602535334965248 2022-11-24 02:17:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Nouriel I beg you, examine the data that came out of the HK outbreak and see if you still feel comfortable repeating the myth about MRNA vaccines from the west being some kind of cure-all.  You have half a million followers. Use your platform to be factual, not promote misinformation.

1595334678268870656 2022-11-23 08:33:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Every news article about a new mass shooting in the US is 20% about the shooting and 80% about other shootings that happened recently, or at a similar time of the year last year, or had other features that made them similar in some way.  It's like baseball stats for murder.
1595278294823636992 2022-11-23 04:49:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MokJonathan @A_Person_hi 54 Operational, 26 Under Construction.  "Planned" numbers pretty shaky and haven't been updated for a while so can't stand by any number but it's somewhere between 80-100.
1595277031583145985 2022-11-23 04:44:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, adding these 4 new Hualong Ones, the Shidaowan site will be home to three diff branches of advanced/next-gen CN nuclear power tech, all with export ambitions, and IP &amp; equipment supply chains almost totally sheltered within China.  A very interesting plant site indeed.  -End  https://t.co/MT14NrBVMl
1595277022234021889 2022-11-23 04:44:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And here's SPIC earlier this year claiming the CAP1400 supply chain is already 92% localized, with intentions to reach 100% (i.e. zero reliance on imported equipment) by next year.  By contrast, the Haiyang 2 CAP1000 was around ~63%  A massive amount of work into localization.  https://t.co/870C8sf9nT
1595277014952738816 2022-11-23 04:44:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I couldn't find any big construction milestones publicized from the builder or owner of the CAP1400s so far.  But here's a Shanghai Electric presser from last year saying they got the order for the 2 units' reactor internals, CRDM, one SG, one pressurizer, and 4 primary pumps.  https://t.co/G4fKh34Y6Z
1595277006824173568 2022-11-23 04:44:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But Shidaowan is also home to the 2 CAP1400 demonstration reactors being built by SPIC.  News on the development of these reactors has been oddly quiet - normally Chinese nuclear industry likes to publicize every little installation milestone, but seems not in this case.  WNA:  https://t.co/yvrLli012D
1595276998783700992 2022-11-23 04:44:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Though many foreign sources refer to the HTGR at this site as "a reactor", CN media consistently refer to a "Unit 1" &amp; "Unit 2" so I'm going with that. The equipment localization rate is ~93%  Huaneng (with Tsinghua) is currently working on a 600MW version of the HTGR too.
1595276995633778688 2022-11-23 04:44:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Countries that have signed framework agreements with China to work towards the possibility of importing  the HTGR tech for energy + desalination needs include Jordan and Saudi Arabia, although those discussions are a little stale at this point and probably need to be refreshed.  https://t.co/v17ahkOehL
1595276988478279681 2022-11-23 04:44:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> e.g. Earlier this month, industry media reported those HTGRs had begun supplying district heat via steam.  This functionality is an important part of its export value proposition, as customers for this tech may want to use the plants for desalination.   https://t.co/hMtpOUIRxm
1595276984887971840 2022-11-23 04:44:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The new reactors will join Huaneng's other reactors at the Shidaowan site: the High Temperature Gas Reactors which achieved first criticality ~a year ago.  They've been in extended testing since then, hitting several other technological milestones.   https://t.co/fpZE2VSN0a
1595276981205356545 2022-11-23 04:44:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> More new China nuclear!   Announced late last week, Huaneng has been approved (EIA report accepted) to move ahead with 4 more Hualong One reactors at Shidaowan NPP in Shandong.

I was trying to find where people were talking about the things I had seen and knew were going on...and only found it on here.

1593502445313101824 2022-11-18 07:12:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Cause yeah, China Twitter often does feel dominated by people outside of China talking to other people outside of China.  But for someone like me on the "inside" hoping to introduce recent, on the ground information to the conversation, that's not a bad audience at all.

What's sad to me is, like you said, that they are tolerated and encouraged and boosted by other people in the anti China community, not sure whether knowingly or otherwise.
1592528971090255872 2022-11-15 14:44:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient Interesting...  Chinese developers are also going to deeper waters...both for the load factors, but also the lower land usage costs. Near shore land usage fees are much higher than for near shore than deep water.  (Cause all the land belongs to the state) üôÉ
1592528049425485824 2022-11-15 14:40:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient The project will not get preferential pricing when it lists volumes in the Shandong power exchange. It'll be treated like any other energy type. That's why they define themselves as "grid parity", because the subsidy was for kW, not kWh. But philosophically I'd say they aren't.
1592527068503605250 2022-11-15 14:36:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient 400 RMB/MWh is the Shandong base energy price for trading in the mid-long term power markets (actually 395.9). When any project claims to be "grid parity" (as this one is) that's the offtake rate we assume as a starting point.
1592524437341220864 2022-11-15 14:26:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient If it's useful to take a different approach, cost per Watt was estimated at 13.4 RMB, according to the project approval documentation. Make of that what you will. It's still a huge cost decline vs. previous years. Hard to say if it could have been built without the subsidy tho.
1592523258104274944 2022-11-15 14:21:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient So the logic of "well, if they were willing to build a project that would only receive the grid benchmark price of ~400 RMB/MWh, their unit construction costs should be around that level (or even lower) was shit logic. Cause they had that damn capacity subsidy at construction.
1592523010254475266 2022-11-15 14:20:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient (In my slight defense, a lot of Chinese media also failed to mention this, which is where I was reading the news from)
1592522859121094657 2022-11-15 14:20:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient It turns out its not true for offshore wind. Some provinces still offer subsidies, even though the national ones have been abolished. After I posted, it was pointed out to me that that Shandong still has a one-off capacity subsidy at construction. Sigh.
1592522570607517696 2022-11-15 14:19:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient Neither it turns out. China doesn't have auctions anymore, not the way we understand them elsewhere. In 2022, it's: "if you build, you will get the base grid price for power - take it or leave it". That's today true for onshore wind and most utility-scale PV.  But...
1592322685736194048 2022-11-15 01:04:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tangobastogne lol
1592320567822385153 2022-11-15 00:56:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient I tend to get quite testy when strangers parachute into my timeline and accuse me of knowing or not knowing things without doing any research first.  Please make VERY sure of your statement before you continue.
1592231515756584960 2022-11-14 19:02:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There are few things that I hate more in life than being wrong, but being responsible for sharing bad information is one of them, so this had to be done.  h/t to @MhehedZherting for pointing out my oversight. Sorry for being a dick.
1592231511897829376 2022-11-14 19:02:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The claimed LCOE of 400 RMB/MWh, if accurate, means the project didn't actually need any subsidy to be profitable selling power in Shandong. It likely COULD have been totally "grid-parity".  But since it seems likely it did get that subsidy, I must mention it.
1592231508152315904 2022-11-14 19:02:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Important correction: This project received a provincial one-off subsidy on capacity from the Shandong government of 800 RMB/kW  Thus, it should not be considered "grid-parity".  I considered deleting the thread entirely but the rest of the information is still accurate...
1592228155460587520 2022-11-14 18:49:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aDissentient What happens between 2019 and 2022? The chart ends a little early...  We saw a spike last year because of rising steel costs but the dropping install costs seemingly helped level it out...
1592226583758397440 2022-11-14 18:42:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thus, it should be inappropriate to refer to this project as "grid-parity". Although it will sell its power into the open markets with no subsidy on volume, it most likely had a one-off capacity subsidy at *construction* of 800CNY/kW. hat tip to @MhehedZherting for the correction
1592226579840921600 2022-11-14 18:42:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *Important note*  Although this project claims to have achieved an LCOE of 400 RMB/MWh, which is nearly level with the coal-fired base price in Shandong, I was unaware that Shandong offers a provincial capacity subsidy for offshore wind constructed from 2022-2024.
1592223307180695554 2022-11-14 18:29:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting @mrmarchee @Y0rkshireH1ker You're right. Sneaky Shandong with a one-off capacity subsidy.  I checked the policy and noted it's capped at 2GW in SD that can earn the subsidy this year. Not sure how much has been built so far.  But if this project got a piece of that subsidy, it's NOT grid parity.
1592215190300655620 2022-11-14 17:57:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting @mrmarchee @Y0rkshireH1ker Sorry, I don't follow where you got the 800k subsidy from?
1592213624961249280 2022-11-14 17:51:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting @Y0rkshireH1ker Mmm. Fair enough. That wasn't called for and I'm sorry.
1592213383826538496 2022-11-14 17:50:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Y0rkshireH1ker @MhehedZherting Alright, you're gone, partially because you're a smug wanker jerking yourself raw over...nothing? But more because I really don't need creepy RW fash types lurking around my TL. Have a good one Christian.
1592210091444670464 2022-11-14 17:37:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting @Y0rkshireH1ker Look, you don't follow me, you've never commented on my content, you just parachuted into my TL with some condescending bullshit without figuring out what I do at all.  Frankly I thought we had reached a point of mutual understanding, but then this Christian dope appeared.
1592209185814745089 2022-11-14 17:33:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting @mrmarchee @Y0rkshireH1ker Grid parity has a specific meaning in the CN energy system. It's a translation of ËØÑ‰ª∑ meaning literally "level price" and it refers to a generating project that receives no extra compensation compared to what a coal project would get for its on-grid tariff (no subsidy).
1592208162064859136 2022-11-14 17:29:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Y0rkshireH1ker @MhehedZherting What are you talking about? We had a whole conversation...did you miss it?  Guys like you watch like a single YouTube video and think you're ready to educate everyone. It's embarrassing. For you. Stop it.
1592197411073830912 2022-11-14 16:46:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting Also I must admit the services on offer vary widely by provincial power market currently. Upon reflection, I'm not sure that either ramping or +inertia are tradable services yet in Shandong. Guangdong, I believe yes. The provincial markets are still VERY fragmented.
1592196491363627008 2022-11-14 16:43:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting There's currently a push within some departments to try to make power users pay for a portion of balancing costs in the next reform of the ancillary services market.  Generally most things that raise power costs for Chinese industry get shot down. So I'm not sure it'll go far...
1592196208319430656 2022-11-14 16:42:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting Coincidentally, I've just finished up a slide on this topic for a training I'm doing next week...  Right now the beneficiary of the ancillary service must bear the cost of the service. So the RE generator must pay.  But...
1592191099367751680 2022-11-14 16:21:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting But that's a problem for at least 10 years along the road, not for 2022, when it's a significant achievement to have worked offshore wind development costs down to such a level where a developer sees a path to good returns, even considering their balancing &amp; backup supply costs.
1592190552803790848 2022-11-14 16:19:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting Currently, the (still maturing) ancillary services market sees RE generators compensate firm dispatch for backup. At the lower rates of RE penetration in China provinces, this is still sustainable. At higher penetration rates, this specific mechanism will be inadequate.
1592190304261910532 2022-11-14 16:18:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MhehedZherting Sure, I'll teach you about wind energy. It's a non-dispatchable, asynchronous energy source, consumed when it is available and of course, backed up by firm (generally thermal) capacity when it is not available. Since Shandong is oversupplied overall, it can accommodate. For now.
1592109134425788417 2022-11-14 10:56:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dale_wen Yes. Although at the moment the process for calculating and issuing the balancing fee is kind of a "black box" process. For now it's done by the grid settlement center ÁîµÁΩëÁªìÁÆó‰∏≠ÂøÉ.
1592106805332971520 2022-11-14 10:46:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bunter999 Coal refers to the regulated base price of coal-fired power in the given province. Contracts for power traded in the wholesale power exchanges refer back to this benchmark.
1592106251902603266 2022-11-14 10:44:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bunter999 These were LCOE reported in industry media.
1592083169691377664 2022-11-14 09:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well yes demand growth actually WILL run out someday, but way after the available rooftops do.
1592079861895802880 2022-11-14 08:59:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's the link to the announcement from the Energy Administration of Shandong.  Lots of nerdy technical details about tons of carbon offset, # of turbines, etc.   https://t.co/cAwzvKDAHo
1592079857932210176 2022-11-14 08:59:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For instance, here's Shanghai a few days ago, soliciting tenders to build an 800 MW offshore wind farm PLUS STORAGE at an unit cost no higher than the Shanghai coal base price of 415.5 RMB/MWh.  This would have been impossible just a few years ago.   https://t.co/v3E0kkfhXj  https://t.co/g8WRTWLMpl
1592079853620441088 2022-11-14 08:59:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's what makes control and mastery of offshore wind development costs so important for China.  It's major part of the equation for coastal provinces securing low-carbon power at reasonable prices (via their preferred in-province investment, not via cross-province imports).
1592079850852212736 2022-11-14 08:59:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For now, some of these provinces have been able to keep their renewable capacity growth strong via mass deployment of rooftop solar (particularly Shandong, which leads the nation).  But the available rooftops will eventually run out, while the growth in demand will not.
1592079848201400322 2022-11-14 08:59:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Offshore wind is particularly important for the long-term decarbonization plans of China's industrialized coastal provinces like Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong precisely because they lack onshore land for deployment of solar or wind (or land usage fees are sky-high).
1592079845470916609 2022-11-14 08:59:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Major factors for LCOE decline:   -Improvements in turbine blades, esp. length, allowing them to generate more power, more cost-effectively.  -Decrease in construction costs due to experience, economies of scale. Big cost drops for crane vessels, maritime labor, maritime cables.
1592079842056744961 2022-11-14 08:59:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For contrast, the average LCOE of the already-existing offshore wind in China is around 790 RMB/MWh, nearly twice as much as this new project. These projects were built a few years ago, during the subsidy era.  In 2010, offshore wind cost per MWh in China was well over 1000 RMB.
1592079838726492166 2022-11-14 08:59:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to the news, the Shandong Bozhong project achieved an LCOE of 400 RMB/MWh, (USD 56.90)  basically at the same level as the Shandong base coal price (394.9 RMB/MWh).  It represents a huge, HUGE decline in construction costs for offshore wind in the past few years.
1592079834330853377 2022-11-14 08:59:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A big milestone for China's offshore wind that I missed a few weeks ago: Shandong's first GRID PARITY offshore wind project (500MW) was connected to the grid.  This means the offshore wind power is generated at a unit cost level competitive with coal-fired power.  Quick üßµ  https://t.co/LeVomrHntl

1591621981920952322 2022-11-13 02:40:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As of a few minutes ago, this specific hotel has received the new orders from pandemic management that they are now shifting to the 5+2 instead of the 7+3, so this group of travelers will end their quarantine with immediate effect.  This should be my quarantine hotel next week.ü§™

1590881526325317632 2022-11-11 01:38:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Regardless of philosophical approach, however, this message from CEC is the same message I'd want to deliver too: CN power prices MUST rise.  This would mostly affect smaller industrials the most, as energy-intensive industries already pay more for power, as allowed by policy.
1590881522307194880 2022-11-11 01:38:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An example of this would be to expand the range at which power contracts may settle, relative to the base price. It's currently at +/- 20%, and I think it could be widened to 30% or more.  That would remove the need for surcharges like this:    https://t.co/lvLs8w9gxK
1590881518289027074 2022-11-11 01:38:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So while they're doing their job to represent generators' interests by calling for the base power prices to be raised, it doesn't mean we'll definitely see what they ask for.  Personally I'd much rather see market-driven pricing revisions, not regulated pricing revisions.
1590881513679523841 2022-11-11 01:38:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So here's the thing about CEC...  It's an industry lobbying group, for the generators.  Don't get me wrong - their datasets are indispensable and everyone cites them because they have no peers in that regard, but they are definitely not industry decision-makers or policymakers.
1590693886225444865 2022-11-10 13:12:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere This guy gained like 9k followers in a week on the back of sharing rumors from wechat groups....Why stop now?

1590215603192999937 2022-11-09 05:31:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sqianz2 Yeah, I do think China is on the path to "outgrow" that kind of simple messaging within a generation or so, as education in rural areas improves. While that style of messaging will become more common (and probably necessary) in the US.
1590211984477532162 2022-11-09 05:17:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @katharintai Right...if we're already at the point where the goal isn't to convince people of a certain position, but just to remind them of the candidate's name and their party affiliation, then the messaging doesn't even matter...
1590211677592891393 2022-11-09 05:16:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @quedecirles_ I wonder if there's some study showing a relationship between sophistication of political messaging and some average education level or whatever? Across states, or different countries...
1590210807132225536 2022-11-09 05:12:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @katharintai They must go through focus groups and stuff like that to determine that any more complex messaging will be too likely to be misunderstood, which is just like...yikes.
1590209867629080576 2022-11-09 05:09:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Honestly it kind of reminded me of the propaganda posters you see in the Chinese countryside which also have a very simplified messaging style e.g.  DO civilized behaviors THINK civilized thoughts BE civilized Chinese people  etc.
1590208699989385216 2022-11-09 05:04:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That was one of the things that really struck me about being in the US just before the elections. The ads going out use this super basic phrasing, barely any compound sentences, it's just like:  "Opponent BAD GUY gaga goo goo I'm the RIGHT CHOICE for YOU googoo
1590207646371807233 2022-11-09 05:00:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Do other countries run political ads where they talk to voters like they are literal infants in a crib?
1590203007026999297 2022-11-09 04:41:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jrmygrdn The silly outcome of treating energy infrastructure investments as bond issues that Mr. and Mrs. Main Street vote on is that you have to dumb down the decision-making process into slogans that appeal to voters, even if they are insane and make no sense for utility companies.

1590193261133836288 2022-11-09 04:03:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gtuckerkellogg @janeqiuchina @dr_handler @propublica @VanityFair "an organised and worrisome effort to corral Chinese disaspora...into misinformation"  ...to my eyes describes dissident media far more accurately than any of the laughably ineffective outreach efforts from the Chinese state.
1590168071045787648 2022-11-09 02:23:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gtuckerkellogg @janeqiuchina @dr_handler @propublica @VanityFair Many dissidents build their entire identity on some version of: "trust me, I'm one of the good ones".  They REALLY hate non-Chinese listening to the "wrong kind" of Chinese.  They demand a monopoly of your attention and trust.
1589910250114920448 2022-11-08 09:18:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Ener_focus Yes, independent retail has existed since 2015. For example Heilan Power Êµ∑ÊæúÁîµÂäõ which is part of the Heilan Group (a large conglomerate most well-known for men's clothing brands).  They cover industrial and commercial power users. Residential is provided by the grid company.
1589886003250364417 2022-11-08 07:42:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Ener_focus Any generator like Huaneng or CGN has a power retailing business (aka ‚Äúgen-tailers‚Äù).  But beyond that there are many power retailing companies that try to make money on wholesale power purchases and sale of power to end users.
1589866766846820354 2022-11-08 06:25:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IlicTos Long term, yes maybe. Short term, no.  Guangdong has a lot of nuclear with more underway and also good offshore wind development potential.
1589866283990142976 2022-11-08 06:23:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZeusGrobbelaar For my sector, very interesting! :)
1589817108111978496 2022-11-08 03:08:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But at least the price increase CAN be passed on to end-users. This is an evolution in philosophy. In the past, the generators would just be expected to eat the losses in order to protect power customers from rate increases.  I just think this band-aid mechanism is clumsy.
1589817105524101120 2022-11-08 03:08:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Moments like this illustrate the limitations of the current state of CN power market liberalization. Sure we have freely trading power markets, but the price guardrails in those markets are still way too confining. 20% is too low.  So this kind of band-aid policy is necessary.
1589817103045251077 2022-11-08 03:08:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But I wouldn't be surprised if it appears in other coastal provinces exposed to high int'l coal prices like Fujian or Hainan.  These provinces are stuck between rock and hard place, far from domestic coal sources, but with int'l fuel prices very volatile.
1589817099354271744 2022-11-08 03:08:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Power wholesalers, for their part, are passing this charge directly on to the end-users in their power supply quotes, which is when we noticed it.  So far we're only seeing it in GD, which has the high exposure to international fuel prices. Most provinces use more domestic coal.
1589817096841875456 2022-11-08 03:08:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This price cap has already been reached, so unless the it is adjusted, coal generators would continue to see huge losses.  The provincial DRC has okayed this short term extra-market "service fee" that coal generators can charge power wholesalers. It's about 0.01 RMB/kWh.
1589817094019100674 2022-11-08 03:08:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Background: Guangdong mid/long-term power contracts are able to settle up to 20% higher than the base coal tariff in that province.  But high coal prices mean that many coal-fired generators aren't making money, with marginal generation cost higher than that base +20% level.
1589817091540275200 2022-11-08 03:08:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting news: We're seeing Guangdong coal-fired power generators have started to charge an out-of-market "service fee" to power buyers, to reduce losses.  This is due to the continued high price of thermal coal, while power prices in the GD power market are unable to rise.

I hope I was able to unearth at least a few real insights amid the goofiness.
1589104213954818048 2022-11-06 03:55:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, this was one of the trickiest things I've ever tried to write. I interviewed at least 10 people to put this together, incl. family, friends, public figures, and business owners.  I don't know that the final result was quite what I imagined, but it's...something.

1589094515847356417 2022-11-06 03:17:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MaryGao Seems to me like plenty of options for preserving the language are available, as long as they don't conflict with (IMO perfectly reasonable) policies about e.g. what language is used for instruction in schools, or for national broadcasts, etc.
1589093489421479936 2022-11-06 03:13:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MaryGao But more importantly - what am I or you supposed to feel about that, and why?  It's a question for the SH'nese themselves to figure out, how they want to go about ensuring their language has its own space. It's not a convenient cudgel for bad-faith geopolitical tourist pundits.
1589090178815365120 2022-11-06 02:59:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MaryGao I didn't feel her low-quality, poorly-considered tweet merited a carefully-considered, high-quality response, which is why my tweet is a bit on the glib side.  I'm aware Shanghainese (like most regional languages) is on a path to decline.

1588105843903717376 2022-11-03 09:48:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman @calbino18 I'd like a platform that allows you to go in and recode and personalize homepage templates via basic HTML like MySpace did.  Looking back, that was super unique and cool and it probably got a bunch of middle schoolers interested in coding.

He mistranslated so much stuff that no one would ever respect his credentials on interpreting the "mysteries of party speak". First walk, then run.  We have standards. You should too.
1587350901307514880 2022-11-01 07:48:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gdemaneuf @janeqiuchina What on earth makes you so confident about something for which you have zero credentials or experience?   And then linking a website with English translations of the documents that native speakers can read in China...You really didn't think that one through did you?
1587347466709454848 2022-11-01 07:35:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @goldencaskcap I don't even agree that any Chinese person can easily understand party documents....As any of us who ever asked a friend for help reading a policy doc can attest.  It takes interest that most people simply don't have...  But this asshole is on a whole 'nother level

1587315598740316160 2022-11-01 05:28:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @biasedsceptic Article isn't biased; it's completely wrong.  The fact that she's still sharing it, even though we have widespread consensus that it's wrong, means she's knowingly spreading false information about China because it serves her own ideology.  That makes her Sinophobic.
1587011794375442432 2022-10-31 09:21:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Guangdong interesting I think. All these approvals in the last few months, right after the Sichuan hydro shortages...  We calc'ed what it would look like for GD if Yunnan hydro exports were ever halved due to a drought (a la Sichuan) and it made a little more sense.
1587011104483741696 2022-10-31 09:18:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Indeed. It would be overly optimistic to attribute all this newbuild coal exclusively to: "backup to support current RE deployment"...not even I have that much good faith.  Decision-making should vary a lot on provincial level I would think.

1586914262286761984 2022-10-31 02:53:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanLong_SOC @ZichenWanghere Funny how you can count on certain Sinophobic commentators to jump in with "omg look at this report" and a whole essay, two days AFTER everyone else has already agreed that it's garbage, based on bad translation.  I don't even think she's competent enough to call it bad faith.
1586892162004029440 2022-10-31 01:25:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SStapczynski @danmurtaugh ...which makes the usage of that oh-so-tired phrase "double down" a bit inaccurate IMO  A note for the editor perhaps @danmurtaugh
1586889746445631490 2022-10-31 01:16:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (I'm oversimplifying more than a bit here about flex generation and backup supply to make a point about the potential role of coal in a VRE-heavy system please don't jump down my throat I'm only just back from vacation thanks)
1586888273909395456 2022-10-31 01:10:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's no coincidence that newly approved Chinese coal plants must be able to ramp down to as low as 30% power.  It's not ideal of course, but they can do it. As can nuclear.  If they can do it more cost-effectively than storage or gas or whatever, then that's how they'll be used.
1586888271564779521 2022-10-31 01:10:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In China, that firm backup could be storage, nuclear, coal, gas, pumped hydro, whatever. It just has to be dispatchable (and ofc inexpensive and IDEALLY clean too).  Begun, the Chinese backup/flex generator war has.
1586888268398104576 2022-10-31 01:10:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's a point of debate &amp; analysis around the world, trying to figure out how much firm backup power a specific wind/solar grid needs.  For example, CSIRO in AU says at high RE penetrations, around 0.8 GW of backup is needed for every 1GW of wind/solar.  https://t.co/zUGwZ20jGy
1586888265747279872 2022-10-31 01:10:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is a solid quote, and (importantly) the logic is simple enough for laypersons to understand, even if they have nothing to do with the power sector.  Underlining for the 5000th time how capacity =/= consumption. You can build scads of new coal plants and use them very little.
1586883407552065537 2022-10-31 00:51:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DolphinSushi2 @WayneSam19 But let's just say for a moment that you DON'T believe ANY studies. You don't believe ANY data. It's all a fucking ploy by the mask corporations to CONTROL THE PEOPLE.  Would you show up in someone's house and not remove your shoes, even though they all do?
1586881400812474369 2022-10-31 00:43:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DolphinSushi2 @WayneSam19 That's weird, here's a meta-analysis of 9 studies of N95 effectiveness, concluding they're significantly better than both a surgical mask and (of course) wearing nothing at all.   https://t.co/4vLFnLjyrn  Literally the first result when you Google "N95 viral transmission study"
1586869352972029952 2022-10-30 23:55:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 It's not bad in China. Very hit or miss in the US.  I had had a long streak of good luck with Airbnb in the US and finally had a bad booking last week for the first time, and I don't even think it was the host's fault.  The reviews really, really matter...

1586485106344333315 2022-10-29 22:28:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Arriving on the island is a totally different story by the way. Nearly no one is wearing masks here, including the locals, similar to China's rural areas. My observation was specific to the airport.
1586282064269037568 2022-10-29 09:01:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Since the Worst People on the Internet are now entering the chat, that's my cue to mute. See ya!

1586264142641385472 2022-10-29 07:50:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WayneSam19 I have no problem with the common brand of Chinese KN95s with the wire band in the nose that bends to form fit around around the nose. And I have a big ol' nose.   Self entitled assholes won't wear masks regardless of comfort.
1586244921580654593 2022-10-29 06:33:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's a French family with a little boy coughing like he's trying to bring up a lung seated three rows ahead of me.  After a month in the USA, catching something in Thailand five days before going back to China would  be...unfortunate.
1586243310070288384 2022-10-29 06:27:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The tourists from the Middle East/South Asia are maybe 50/50 on the masking I'd say. But that sample is much smaller.
1586236815211606017 2022-10-29 06:01:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Takes some real chutzpah to arrive as a guest in a foreign country, observe a veritable sea of local masked faces, and say "nah I'm good".  Since Oct 1, TH doesn't require a proof of negative test, proof of vaccination... Nothing. Open doors.  Wonder how this'll go for them.
1586236813055647744 2022-10-29 06:01:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the Bangkok DMK airport, there are signs everywhere asking people to wear masks, but it's not aggressively enforced.  95% of travelers are wearing masks. 95% of the white people are not.  Nearly every unmasked face you see is a white one.

1586189102533050368 2022-10-29 02:52:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HAPPY889123 My most recent experience...I think Ê≠¢Âí≥ËçØ Is very straightforward and literal for a machine to translate, compared to "cough suppressant".
1586186149944389638 2022-10-29 02:40:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay Damn, Thai isn't supported (that's where I am now). I downloaded it, but looks like I gotta stick to GT for now.
1586185441409085440 2022-10-29 02:37:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay Yeah that's what I've been hearing. Haven't tried it yet but apparently need to....
1586182886817873921 2022-10-29 02:27:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I was having a really rough time with machine translation English to Turkish in Istanbul, but had much higher rate of communication success when I switched to Chinese to Turkish instead.  Have had same experience with Thai and Korean.  Wonder if Romance languages would favor ENG?
1586182884800413697 2022-10-29 02:27:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting: For languages I don't know, I consistently get better machine translation results when I start with CN rather than English.  I think maybe it has something to do with the logic of how CN compound words are constructed that makes them easier for machines to translate.
1586168835736231937 2022-10-29 01:31:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere USA average power consumption per capita is about 2.5x China's.  Water usage per capital was closer to 3x China's I believe, although I haven't looked at recent figures. China's water use per capita has been declining slightly in recent years.
1585631499629391873 2022-10-27 13:56:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelWorobey Frankly this behavior suggests to me that he might be unwell in some way.

1585465600792469504 2022-10-27 02:57:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread Whether or not people believe this or not isn't even a China expertise or ideology question; it's just logic and a tiny bit of data literacy.  It's kinda helpful though, in that it helps you weed out the dumb people for immediate discarding of opinions.
1585431634609774592 2022-10-27 00:42:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Mmm yeah I chose to focus on a different part of the statement, but I guess I get the annoyance. I wonder who she's follpwing in the end, if (seemingly) no Twitter users in China...
1585344922999455744 2022-10-26 18:57:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Heyoooo44262915 There are unhinged takes everywhere but they aren't that influential I think. They get a lot of traction from psychos on Twitter maybe, but not really from people in actual decision making positions in govt or business.

1585328035732942853 2022-10-26 17:50:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *depending on country
1585327807105683457 2022-10-26 17:49:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's definitely not as convenient or affordable to maintain CN expertise as it used to be.  But if you're serious about this sector, the extra effort to cross those barriers and get over here should be worth it.  If it isn't worth it to you, how serious are you, really?
1585327804753010688 2022-10-26 17:49:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And yes there's still a 7+3 quarantine. I'm sorry.  But what's more important to you? Your credibility as a commentator/pundit? Or a week?  If you can't give up the latter, you WILL lose the former.
1585327801338851328 2022-10-26 17:49:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, direct flights to SH or BJ are a little bit crazy price-wise, but you can get a decent price on a flight to HK and enter mainland that way.  Since October 1, you can also fly to Bangkok (no quarantine) and catch a connection into Kunming or Nanning fairly inexpensively.
1585327798885167104 2022-10-26 17:49:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know that L visas are still not available, but if I was not China-based and my career was based on being knowledgeable on China, I'd be scrambling like crazy to get a sponsor for F/M visa so I could get back on the ground. That's been available for over 2 months now?
1585327796049432576 2022-10-26 17:49:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sure, I'm not any less knowledgeable than I was a month ago, but I'm certainly not scrolling WeChat like I normally would, talking with friends/colleagues like I normally would, not chatting with clients and partners like I normally would.  My finger is off the pulse. I admit it.
1585327792912097280 2022-10-26 17:49:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...and though she doesn't actually SAY that it's a problem that the West's most followed pundits on China haven't been in China for 3 years, it's implied, and I agree.  I've been traveling in the US now for just a month and hardly even dare to open my mouth on recent China stuff.
1585001185320148992 2022-10-25 20:11:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @Xxsethmonsterxx Hahaha honored
1585001010426417152 2022-10-25 20:11:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @eaglewa90656657 Yes this is a good point. In China, the workers leave but they remit funds back to their home communities. A lot less of this in the US.
1585000656058056705 2022-10-25 20:09:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh Maine has a crazy number of cities and towns named after other countries. Off the top of my head....  Sweden, Maine New Sweden, Maine New Canada, Maine Norway, Maine Denmark, Maine China, Maine Mexico, Maine Peru, Maine Poland, Maine  And there's even more named for cities...
1584999208826064896 2022-10-25 20:03:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @typhoidX No, not really. I'll talk about politics in the next section, but overall the political climate is much harder to get things done these days compared to the past. The era when Big Programs might have been possible is basically in the past I think.
1584824202728988672 2022-10-25 08:28:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thanks in advance for reading, especially if you only follow me for China stuff and decided to give this a look anyway.  And I'd love to hear any thoughts, comments, and questions.  Regularly scheduled China programming will return shortly. üòé
1584824200816398336 2022-10-25 08:28:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's all for now. I will be posting my Part 2 in a few days, once I've had more time to organize my thoughts &amp; tease out some deeper conclusions.  I interviewed ~10 people to write this piece, including a state senator, and I want to make sure I'm doing my interviewees justice!
1584824198739861504 2022-10-25 08:28:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Adopting China's capital-intensive approach in the US seems impossible.  It needs local elected leaders to commit to expensive policy programs that won't come to fruition for years, leaving them politically vulnerable while they spend taxpayer money with little to show for it...
1584824196659843072 2022-10-25 08:28:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the other hand, the US is unlikely to coordinate its resources and political capital into "build it and they will come" for rural dev.  It must rely on federal grants and loans, public-private partnerships, and the efforts of individual entrepreneurs with high risk tolerance.
1584824194080309249 2022-10-25 08:28:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But the guiding philosophy is of course very different between the two countries, which leads to different policy outcomes.  China has adopted a "build it and they will come" philosophy for much of its infrastructure, and rural development is no different.  https://t.co/bYC6HNx4nV
1584824191991181313 2022-10-25 08:28:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Both countries seem to believe that a world where 90% of our population lives in cities, a world where rural life disappears and becomes an anachronism, is a future to be avoided.  And they are deploying big resources in an attempt to engineer a different outcome.
1584824189730443264 2022-10-25 08:28:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Crucially for the thesis of my essay, it seems both China and the USA have rejected the premise that maximum urbanization is desirable or inevitable.  Both countries are working on solutions to "save" their countryside and "upgrade" them to be ready for the 21st century.
1584824187700793346 2022-10-25 08:28:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These issues are hardly unique to Maine, though, as they affect rural areas all across the USA and the world, including China.  In China, we have seen how rural towns are often comprised almost entirely of the elderly and young children, as working-age adults seek work elsewhere.
1584824184383107073 2022-10-25 08:28:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To compound these structural economic problems, our shrinking population has led to a severe labor shortage and chronic worker crisis.  Even if we could attract new employers to move in, they would probably struggle to find workers.  https://t.co/VaBRzOQZwq
1584824179660312576 2022-10-25 08:28:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most of this essay focuses on the rural parts of ME, specifically my home county of Aroostook, up in the north.  Aroostook has a high poverty rate, a stagnant economy, &amp; a shrinking, aging population. Our communities have struggled to find new roles in the 21st century economy.  https://t.co/Tz3WUsPayO

1584054906884829184 2022-10-23 05:31:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @goldencaskcap I'm personally offended that LQ still has a political career.

1582827096212008960 2022-10-19 20:12:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You know those things that suck and everyone knows, and it becomes a cultural trope to complain about this Awful Thing, then it quietly gets much better than it used to be, but no one notices?  I'd like to confirm that flying in the USA is still not one of those things.
1582244004313190400 2022-10-18 05:35:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @XianyangCB It's moments like this that I'm so glad most of my education about China was gained outside US academia.
1581637736972238849 2022-10-16 13:26:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangxifan Wish I could read it - I can use GT, but it's also paywalled.  I have had very different experiences and reached very different conclusions. But more importantly than what you or I think, the audience of the speech would not see this as something promised and not delivered.
1581633844028923904 2022-10-16 13:11:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangxifan How do you justify the statement that the Party has not delivered on poverty alleviation?  Certainly implementation has seen issues here and there, but it's just not accurate to say the relevant programming and resources and investment Ôø•Ôø• were promised and not delivered.

It might be easier to refute, but it's irrelevant, so you aren't countering anything. Bummer, dude.‚òπÔ∏è

1579842207099785217 2022-10-11 14:31:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TypischTelstar @ChinaDriven I remember reading this article a few years ago about such a conflict:   https://t.co/JgI9zXjiQI
1579839953416392708 2022-10-11 14:22:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YunyufeiL When was this? Brunswick is quite the thriving little town these days...especially the area around Bowdoin. I had lunch there last week.
1579839284437450752 2022-10-11 14:20:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @matt__kendrick For sure!  I think there's a foundation in quick-serve restaurant "chains that aren't really chains" in China.  Like Shaxian Snacks, or Yellow Braised Chicken Pot...they have some kind of nationwide alliance and they all taste really similar but it's not an ACTUAL chain per se.
1579838528292556801 2022-10-11 14:17:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kiukiuli That's amazing
1579838110854426624 2022-10-11 14:15:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @matt__kendrick ...and upon reflection, this is probably why the food tastes so similar across different restaurants. They are all making the same recipes.  McDonald's spends millions to achieve uniformity of taste. They should consult with the Chinese restaurant community cartel!
1579835546104647683 2022-10-11 14:05:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 It's honestly fine, usually 6 or 7 - not award-winning but not gross or anything. The biggest issue is usually that things have been made sweeter for American tastes but you can ask them to hold the sugar.
1579832829319737344 2022-10-11 13:54:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @matt__kendrick Yep! Apparently there's also a shared database of recipes too, so the new arrivals can get the immediate download on preparing crab rangoon and orange chicken - I found this out from a new Chinese place in FL a few years ago whose owners (from Xi'an) had literally just arrived.
1579832165009088514 2022-10-11 13:51:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shout out to the fortitude of all the Chinese families who raised their kids as the only Asian faces for 50 miles in any direction in a frozen backwoods town of literally 2000 people in the whitest state in the nation
1579831447552405504 2022-10-11 13:49:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One Chinese family per town, neatly dispersed across the whole state like there's an invisible force field keeping them from overlappinig with other's territory.
1579831116663762944 2022-10-11 13:47:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Literally the town's economy could be disappearing into the dirt and the last businesses standing will be the gas station and the Chinese restaurant.
1579830231531425793 2022-10-11 13:44:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's amazing how many small Maine towns have just two places to get something to eat: a gas station and a Chinese restaurant
1578373950387605504 2022-10-07 13:17:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @ben_gc Honestly I'm a bit annoyed that he didn't do it in English,  from an aesthetic appreciation of joke funniness perspective.
1578033400308719617 2022-10-06 14:44:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But for all its beauty, this part of Maine is really struggling economically. The rural parts of northern Maine are on a multi-decade decline with many challenges and few options for recovery.  I have been preparing a new essay on this topic that I hope to share soon. Stay tuned.  https://t.co/rfcYnqP1Vz
1578033382696460289 2022-10-06 14:44:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's been 14 years since I've been back here in the fall. I always come back for Christmas, when it's cold and white and miserable (though pretty).  The smells, sights, and feels of Maine in the fall are intoxicating. I have re-remembered why people enjoy being here.  https://t.co/qZNZUW9ve2
1578033341714288642 2022-10-06 14:44:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some friendly ducks joined me as I snapped pictures. Then the owner of a nearby camping site came out to chat.  She told me the leaves are late this year and I should come back in a week or two when they'll be really beautiful. Too bad I'll be gone by then...  https://t.co/HnOJ5s7HZk
1578033294331215876 2022-10-06 14:43:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Long Lake, about 20 minutes away, is another annoyingly beautiful destination.  The newer summer camps along its shores are owned by out-of-staters, while the older camps are owned by locals.  It really looks like a postcard...  https://t.co/qurCGRbCJs
1578033268120702976 2022-10-06 14:43:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Scenes from around my parents' home. Splitting firewood is an important fall activity up here.  If you have a wood burning stove, it cuts oil heating costs a LOT. I helped my dad split about a half cord of firewood. I was 15 years out of practice, but muscle memory still there.  https://t.co/J0HYHu1yxJ
1578033223824986116 2022-10-06 14:43:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A lot of properties around here have wild apples or semi-wild apples on their lawns.  They've often been cross pollinated so much that the apples are sour and basically inedible.  This apple tree on my parents' lawn, however, is good for both fresh eating and applesauce.  https://t.co/OqJJ62PmXY
1578033180451667968 2022-10-06 14:43:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Speaking of the town airstrip, (that you walk across to get to the river trail) we saw this small airplane parked on the grass.  It was unlocked, because of course it was. We don't lock our homes or cars; why would we lock our airplanes?  New solar panels mounted nearby.  https://t.co/nAqUbgVhov
1578033139196125195 2022-10-06 14:43:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The day we went, we were the only ones there.  There's some rocks where you can walk out to the water, a trail for kayakers to portage around, and a single park bench with a BBQ grill.  I think this could easily be a 4A tourist attraction in China...  https://t.co/eKhRkW3GEn
1578033117339623425 2022-10-06 14:43:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Maples and other deciduous trees begin to change leaf color in Sept. in New England, as soon as it starts frosting at night (temperatures just below zero).  It's a big tourist attraction up here in the fall. We call them leaf peepers. My hometown is far north, so it starts early.  https://t.co/xqHwG9ffRU
1578033061014355969 2022-10-06 14:42:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To reach it, you have to cross our town's tiny grass airstrip and walk through this scenic spruce and maple forest down to the river.  It smells like wet earth, and sweet musty decaying leaves, and crisp acidic pine needles.  https://t.co/DK43A1ZITv
1578033028194267137 2022-10-06 14:42:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Warning: obnoxiously beautiful Maine scenery ahead.  In my hometown, there is a section of river rapids called the Fish River Falls.  It used to be kind of a hidden gem, mostly visited by locals, but now it's been designated a National Scenic Byway, so the word's getting out.  https://t.co/zIv1gtuf7Y
1578004524995940352 2022-10-06 12:49:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In my neighborhood in SH there's a recent trend of coffee shops offering cocktails &amp;and beer in the evenings, so they can extend their hours/get more business throughout the day.  I think the logic is "I rent this place for all of the 24 hours in a day so I'm gonna use them!"
1578003240188350464 2022-10-06 12:44:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My biggest point of reverse culture shock on this trip so far is how so many coffee shops and cafes in the US close at like...2pm.

1575194721617690625 2022-09-28 18:44:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Probably unintentional/unconscious from the OP, but referring to a sample of 15 Western nations (Israel and Hungary debatable) plus SK and Japan as "the world" is not a classification system that makes much sense to me.  This is a bad habit that must be slowly unlearned, IMO.

1573863618948521984 2022-09-25 02:35:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere But I also have a (much longer): "'No way! That person is a moron, and if you can't recognize that, you must be a moron too!" list.
1573863164927696896 2022-09-25 02:33:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere Yeah there's always a bias towards thinking people who agree with you are credible (and those who don't are not).  The list of people I respect and consider credible although I often disagree honestly isn't super long. But I do have one, and do try to add to it.
1573861232519651329 2022-09-25 02:25:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere This is one of those basic litmus test things.  If you wanna do China stuff, you should be able to identify who is a credible member of the conversation (even if you disagree with them) and who is just a fringe weirdo.  And then know to never waste time on the fringe weirdos.

1573076633556238361 2022-09-22 22:27:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rocket_feather This seems like the topic of a very niche comparison study...How do host cities comparatively handle traffic and security management for major international events like G20?
1573074385862287360 2022-09-22 22:18:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It was like this for many, many blocks. Actual thousands of NYPD, officers, SWAT, counterterrorism units, and constant buzzing helicopters overhead.  I wonder what the labor and material cost to the NYPD is for such a mobilization? I wonder what the carbon footprint is?

The account is a little too aggressive with the bit sometimes, making me wonder if it's a parody account.  But even it's not, I blocked it, because it's just disruptive trolling at the end of the day, even if it's supposed to be parody.
1572055143750959104 2022-09-20 02:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shenzhen Shekou Cruise Terminal has seen busier days.  Currently just 3/20ish ferry routes are running, so most of the space is empty right now.  Makes the check-in process for me very smooth and easy though!  Just 30 minutes to HK airport.  https://t.co/CzAYoAWvuf
1571777189510807552 2022-09-19 08:24:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Flight from Shanghai to Shenzhen took just 1hr 50min, landing 50 minutes early(!)   Less congestion in the Chinese skies these days...
1571740131484368898 2022-09-19 05:57:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TypischTelstar @visitshaanxi This is a great anecdote...And makes a lot of sense
1571701093666820096 2022-09-19 03:21:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @visitshaanxi Nice one, marketing manager. Out of sight, out of mind, isn't that right?  https://t.co/H5KS3ahnht
1571686371114491904 2022-09-19 02:23:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @visitshaanxi Shit, those are my tax dollars too
1571680725233201154 2022-09-19 02:00:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @visitshaanxi Who is this for? You can't get a tourist visa for China right now. And even if you could, there's a 7+3 day quarantine.  Go tell your manager that English Twitter promoted tweets asking people to visit Shaanxi is a silly use of marketing funds.
1571352990937939969 2022-09-18 04:18:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dk_seh tweeting is clearly not a sport for the neurotic then

1571130460910276609 2022-09-17 13:34:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. Oh and this movie is really bleak.  It's kind of a love story...if you stretch the definition a bit. I'd call it a tragic drama, interspersed with moments of tenderness &amp; hope, but which ultimately yield to further bleakness.  Don't watch it when you're sad. But do watch it.
1571130457751982080 2022-09-17 13:34:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So if you want to watch this movie and catch the buzz as a non-Chinese person, especially if you've had limited China experience, I really recommend getting a CN friend to watch it with you and explain things. There are so many great little details you might miss otherwise.
1571130455134703617 2022-09-17 13:34:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> the director doesn't hold the audience's hand in the slightest.  Many cultural complexities and nuances are presented or implied without explanation and will certainly be underappreciated or missed by average western audiences, leaving them with less to talk about.
1571130451804422144 2022-09-17 13:34:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. This is a movie that western film critics have really struggled to get their heads around. While the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, I feel they're also v. superficial.  I don't think its their fault though. This movie may have been made for an international audience, but
1571130448792920065 2022-09-17 13:34:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The female lead, Hai Qing, the only professional actor in the movie, spent a year living in Gansu, learning the local language to deliver her lines in it.  Aside from a few jarring segments in Mandarin (re-records maybe?) I feel she does really well.  This from Sixth Tone:  https://t.co/7UR7N1983g
1571130443508125698 2022-09-17 13:34:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I also particularly appreciated the commitment to having all the dialogue in the local Gansu language.   It always bugged me in the past when a movie supposedly took place in some rural region of China, but all the locals' speech was dubbed over with perfect Beijing Mandarin.
1571130441020870656 2022-09-17 13:34:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. The actual filmmaking  Is really good. The camera work and editing are notably thoughtful and measured, lingering on characters' faces and scenes, giving us all the time we need to really feel these characters, their thoughts, their emotions. The movie takes its time.
1571130438227496962 2022-09-17 13:34:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The impression is that while these programs are well-intentioned and conceived at a strategic level, they can suffer from spotty, inefficient, or illogical execution at a local level.  That should surprise absolutely no one, but it's notable to see it portrayed so candidly.
1571130435685732352 2022-09-17 13:34:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At other points in the movie, some villagers agree to have their homes torn down to collect a bonus of 15k RMB and improve the village appearance.  Ironically, these are villagers who have already moved away and are making good money in SZ, NOT the impoverished homeless couple.
1571130432682622977 2022-09-17 13:34:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Naturally, we view movie events from the main characters' eyes.  So when the couple gets a free new apartment but it has no space for their pigs, chickens and mule - their livelihood - it's not an abstract issue, but very real.  I'd heard this before:  https://t.co/kHemJ75oNf
1571130429947912192 2022-09-17 13:34:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Depiction of gov't poverty alleviation projects in the movie  I think this is the content that surprised Chinese film buffs when the movie got a full theatrical release here, because its treatment in the movie, while not overtly critical, is not glowingly positive either.
1571130427351638017 2022-09-17 13:34:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Remember that there are ~500 million rural citizens in China. Even if poverty like you saw in the movie represents only the bottom 1% of the population, that's still 5 million people struggling on the border of 'extreme' poverty and 'regular' poverty.
1571130424788938756 2022-09-17 13:34:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. Was the poverty in the movie been exaggerated or played up for consumption by a Western filmgoing audience?  I didn't think so. While the film shows conditions that are no longer mainstream, they are certainly still a reflection of reality for some part of the population.
1571130420233904128 2022-09-17 13:34:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I finally saw Return to Dust Èô∑ÂÖ•Â∞òÁÉü yesterday.  I wanted to jot down a few comments on what I thought was a thoughtful, emotional, and intimate look at human bonds amid rural poverty in China. Go watch it!  h/t: @ruima and her great thread on this movie:  https://t.co/Pq6YG2St80  https://t.co/VUJHPpdM3S

1570981232355471361 2022-09-17 03:41:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GhostOfFrederic The plants are obviously growing well enough with reduced sunlight, as you can see from the videos.  Certain crops would do poorly with direct sunlight all day and can be successful with sunlight in the mornings and late afternoons and shade at midday.
1570980484511072257 2022-09-17 03:38:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ColinDavdButler @Even_Pay Sorry it's rice paddies, not wheat:    https://t.co/DZLWMqfu1U

1570742700105928711 2022-09-16 11:53:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Even_Pay Perhaps counterintuitively, some studies I looked at today suggested that for certain crops in certain climates, being shaded by the panels INCREASES crop yields, since it reduces water evaporation and allows the soil to retain more moisture.
1570741735441207297 2022-09-16 11:49:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Even_Pay No ü•≤  This is why I'm dying that I was in a hotel during this visit, unable to ask questions like this

1570655752762855424 2022-09-16 06:08:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @solar_chase Sorry total brain fart...It's rice, not wheat. I dunno where I got wheat from.   You can see the sunken rice paddy with the water in some shots and I think it is clearer in the drive through video. From the first vid viewing platform all you can see is the weeds on the edge.
1570654979714863104 2022-09-16 06:05:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ***rice! not wheat!***  I don't know why I said wheat...Brain fart. Those are rice paddies (you can see the water in some of the shots).
1570611148269158401 2022-09-16 03:10:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @parliament522 At this facility, probably manually. Although I've seen some agri-solar vendors offer panels on mounts that are tall enough to drive machinery under.

1570606656391876608 2022-09-16 02:53:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CampuGeorgie They shouldn't be leaking anything during their lifespan - they are sealed. If the soil is exposed to toxic chemicals, it's a big manufacturing or maintenance failure.  The metals within the panel ARE a concern during disposal at end of life when they get crushed up.
1570603657540014084 2022-09-16 02:41:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PowderHoundPup The panels are mounted unusually high off the ground and are more spaced out than a normal ground-mounted solar PV facility to allow sunlight to also hit the plants below.  I don't know about this facility, but other facilities allow adjusting the panels to optimize too.
1570599174764367872 2022-09-16 02:23:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These videos and pictures were taken by my colleague yesterday, who was on a different train and didn't get taken to quarantine.  They didn't go to see the solar fish farm in the end, but this agri-solar facility instead.  This is what was taken from me... :(  https://t.co/Z53x4ZH9Ss
1570599106669850624 2022-09-16 02:23:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A drive through the 150MW facility shows the size of the solar panels, as well as the scale of the facility itself.  They can turn on their supports to follow the sun throughout the day and maximize output.  Zhejiang averages about 1250 hours/annum of solar irradiance.  https://t.co/A4aQvacrbJ

1570420775655735296 2022-09-15 14:34:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg Yeah...
1570412805828014080 2022-09-15 14:02:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg Ah I see. My wife doesn't have a HK travel pass at the moment, though so we have to do the airport ferry route to avoid entering HK.
1570394299086573569 2022-09-15 12:49:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhaoxo Yes I considered that too. Or maybe the local party secretary secretly follows me me on Twitter and realized I'm just such a nice guy.
1570393938175094784 2022-09-15 12:47:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg It'll be Monday, but seems like yes. Fingers crossed, knock on wood, insert other warding superstitious activity, etc.
1570380752197681152 2022-09-15 11:55:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhaoxo We were gonna try, since the local  company that invited us a large company, probably one of the largest taxpayers in the city, but we hadn't asked yet. We ourselves are a pretty small company.
1570378053918011403 2022-09-15 11:44:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So maybe it was one of those "You guys don't live here and we don't want to be responsible for you. Go back where you came from and if you actually get sick you'll be someone else's problem" kind of situations. Just a guess though.
1570377231423373313 2022-09-15 11:41:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think it was a combination of being low risk (5 cars away) and that my colleagues and I are here for work, originally intending to leave today. The pandemic prevention office made a "special application", flipped our codes to green, and drove us to the train station.
1570376412804296704 2022-09-15 11:38:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay and then here's an option that I hadn't considered at all: a 1-day quarantine and then...I'm done.  At this moment I'm heading back to Shanghai. So weird but I'm totally ok with it.    https://t.co/gUcjzDSLp8
1570375813316616192 2022-09-15 11:35:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Plot twist:   I'm now on a train heading back to Shanghai, with a green code. I'm not entirely how/why this happened, but I'm not complaining.  What a bizarre 24 hours.
1570308255783714824 2022-09-15 07:07:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZeusGrobbelaar Oh wow you guys are practicing the Shanghai model of lockdown management. You have my understanding and sympathy...
1570307471188852738 2022-09-15 07:04:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg I think that's the correct take...  Kind of hard to plan around though! There's like 30k RMB of tickets and bookings swinging on this right now.
1570305249122058240 2022-09-15 06:55:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Update Update: The local pandemic prevention bureau still says it's 3+4 when I called. But my colleagues got a call from elsewhere telling them it's 7. No idea what's going on now.  Either I'm canceling and moving a bunch of flights and tickets and bookings...or...I'm not. ü§™
1570291874556157952 2022-09-15 06:02:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is shaping up to be some very disruptive (and expensive) bad luck.  Oh and I only have one change of clothes, since it was supposed to be an overnight trip. No takeout, no deliveries.  Don't get stuck in quarantine in a small city guys. üò≥
1570290732682088448 2022-09-15 05:57:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Update: seems it could be 7 days' quarantine now. The case was confirmed, everyone on the same car is a close contact, and everyone on the rest of the train (including me) is a "secondary close contact".  Looks like my travel to the US in 5 days will be affected.

1570039447189856257 2022-09-14 13:19:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 Apparently the person got on the train at Taizhou, well after leaving Shanghai. And they were only detected when we got off the train in Yueqing. Just really bad luck.
1570036026667864068 2022-09-14 13:05:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well, after 2 months of undisturbed travel around central China, it looks like karma finally caught up to me.

1569274025163243523 2022-09-12 10:37:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ritacyliao Well, it would be pretty egregious to run a 10AM ferry to catch a 2PM flight if there's an 8-hour wait in the middle. üò≥ I hope/trust things have smoothed out a bit since then - when did you last make this trip?
1569273050595721217 2022-09-12 10:33:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moshaosen This probably explains the thing we were just discussing
1569272885449224192 2022-09-12 10:33:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ritacyliao Ah, it's good to know that ÂõûÊ∏ØÊòì has now been extended to nation-wide. When I used it for the first time last year, I think it was only applicable for Guangdong (where I was at the time).  Yeah the non-HK resident I happen to live with is the biggest complicating factor :)
1569268422504235009 2022-09-12 10:15:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nuclearzak @PattyforGaPSC @Tpsmyth01 @HopfJames @timechols @MeredithAngwin @Ben_Inskeep @NuclearHazelnut @NuclearQuaffle @Heather_mom4nuk This is a class response to some truly churlish antics from a prospective state public servant. Nice.
1569264693092679680 2022-09-12 10:00:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ritacyliao As for timing, the ferry operator has told me to expect ~2 hours at the terminal before departure, plus the normal 30-ish minute ride across SZ Bay. That's the Shekou Cruise Terminal --&gt; HKIA direct ferry link.
1569264193626570752 2022-09-12 09:58:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ritacyliao Really? I live in Shanghai now, so my understanding is I would not qualify for quarantine-free entry under Return2HK (I do have an HKID) or Come2HK unless I spend the prior 2 weeks in Guangdong.  (and my wife, as a Mainland citizen, qualifies for neither)
1569240951243288578 2022-09-12 08:26:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TYL_ie You actually need to have bought a departing flight already before you can book a ferry ticket, so I don't think they are ticket squatters. I had to give all my booking and flight info to the Taobao vendor to input into his computer program.
1569227056432705542 2022-09-12 07:30:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moshaosen Yeah you're right. That's confusing.
1569226391421620224 2022-09-12 07:28:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DiddlySquat51 @TypischTelstar Yeah I don't think that ferry is running yet. Most of the ferries are still down. :/
1569225966018510848 2022-09-12 07:26:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moshaosen I think it means that coming from high-risk places within Guangdong would also exclude you from using the program.  i.e. an AND condition where both parts must be satisfied.  That's my reading anyway...
1569222428366340098 2022-09-12 07:12:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thechinapodcast With a name like yours, I trust you know what you're talking about :)
1569222322170789890 2022-09-12 07:12:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moshaosen With come2hk you can go directly to the airport. But that program can only be used if you've spent the prior two weeks in Guangdong.  So that's a good point...it's an option for you, and an option for me if I wanted to go down to SZ for two weeks first.
1569216550305157120 2022-09-12 06:49:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ThomasShaBeng Oh maybe this?   https://t.co/C4rG8VKmV4
1569216229298302977 2022-09-12 06:47:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ThomasShaBeng Do you have a link?  I've seen this WoodMac podcast but it seems to have a broader focus, although the name is similar   https://t.co/asu51G9Wys
1569212923813462016 2022-09-12 06:34:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And is anyone doing something on a similar topic for China already?  I don't listen to a lot of podcasts myself personally so I don't know if I'd be overlapping with something that someone else is already doing.
1569212321897259010 2022-09-12 06:32:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thinking about trying to start a China energy/power/electricity podcast. Who would listen to that?
1569210463795445760 2022-09-12 06:25:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The moral of the story is that Taobao is undefeated.   But also a second moral is: don't be a dummy like I was. If you are in Mainland and thinking of flying out of HKIA to enjoy the much cheaper flights, make sure you check for ferry ticket availability first. üôÑ
1569210461618589697 2022-09-12 06:25:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fingers crossed, I paid this Taobao vendor and then waited. After a week of anxiety, I got the message I had been waiting for - we got tickets!  I had to pay an extra 400CNY per ticket to use the software scalper service. But it was still way cheaper than the alternative.
1569210458384777216 2022-09-12 06:25:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Out of desperation, I searched for ferry tickets on Taobao to see if anyone was scalping them, and found you can pay a company to run a computer script 24/7 refreshing the ticket website every 30 seconds.  The instant someone returns tickets, they can auto-buy them for you.  https://t.co/sCbeMDnOlx
1569210445340487680 2022-09-12 06:24:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This was a huge problem because if we couldn't take that ferry, we would have to take the land border into HK, which means formally entering HK and being subject to a quarantine.  Or trying to find a flight to HK from the mainland that could transfer our luggage (difficult).
1569210442899427329 2022-09-12 06:24:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So here's a funny story of victory/a word of warning.  The ferry tickets from SZ to HK Airport sell out EARLY...like months in advance.  I didn't know this. I bought our flights out of HK and then found out the ferry tickets were totally sold out for the morning we need to fly.üôÉ
1568526839525834755 2022-09-10 09:08:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mrfungfung @pajolicoe @janarhertz @tomstan33764596 Interesting. How long did it take for you to get a slot in the daily crossing quota?
1568521990742614017 2022-09-10 08:49:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta There's that fine Finnish nihilism I needed to cheer me up
1568507026992414720 2022-09-10 07:49:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @drvolts @JHWeissmann Additional background and context on China building coal plants in general.   What constitutes "wasteful" in the context of how new Chinese coal plants are likely to be used (as backup for VRE) is open to interpretation IMO.   https://t.co/9p9srPjlsG

It was a Vienna Hotel, reasonably new, with a view of a quiet street with trees. But I understand winning the lottery might take some time.
1568466779625893889 2022-09-10 05:09:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tomstan33764596 @janarhertz You were able to get a flight from HK to Wuhan? I'm still trying to figure out how I'll get back from HK in early November.
1568465981525364738 2022-09-10 05:06:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Every time I post a take like this, I risk people saying I'm being snobby, gatekeeping, or even pretentious (hey! that word's in my twitter handle!)   But I'll risk it 100x over before I accept the epidemic of low standards/general mediocrity in China studies in the West.
1568459727251832832 2022-09-10 04:41:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Phil_Renninger Yeah probably...makes sense.
1568455028431798272 2022-09-10 04:23:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman I'm referring to how the author used ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇËä± when they meant ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÂåñ. I think publishing a low-level typo like this betrays they aren't really proficient.  I think it's fine to use Chn in Eng writing for words that aren't conveniently translated. I do it all the time actually.

1568445330743787522 2022-09-10 03:44:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Side note, but is ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÂåñ a TW phrasing or something?  I have only seen ÂüéÂ∏ÇÂåñ and ÂüéÈïáÂåñ in Mainland.  I've never seen these words used in contrast to refer to differing levels of urbanization. Is that accurate? I had thought they were synonymous.
1568443937643438082 2022-09-10 03:39:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Western academics who aren't actually proficient in Chinese trying to inject fragments of Chinese into their work and messing it up could be the basis of a whole gimmick account on Twitter.  Granted the audience would be pretty niche, but still.  This is right in the abstract.  https://t.co/DKk6o6YFFx
1568162761045331968 2022-09-09 09:01:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece Yeah it's something friends back home pick up immediately for me too.  I actually have sympathy to the idea that it's pronounced "Shaing hai" in English and "Shahng hai" in Chinese and there's no need to "mix" languages. But I still say it "properly" out of habit.
1568159660229955584 2022-09-09 08:49:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece I live in SHAING high. What about you?
1568145372173959168 2022-09-09 07:52:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jwickers Not yet. But I think he's one of those "if he hasn't blocked you, you're probably doing something wrong" types, so fingers crossed.
1568144685545439232 2022-09-09 07:50:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let's just ignore the whole decade that has gone into explaining why CN solar panel costs have come down so much and instead base the "analysis" on vibes and bullshit, shall we?   https://t.co/2wzzmJuP1D   https://t.co/MaXCxpMpXX   https://t.co/vob6H6nfoy   https://t.co/tNFDWhqEtB

1568119542362312704 2022-09-09 06:10:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @johanstrauss90 If you do, I'd be interested to read it. I am so focused on my one market of coverage (China) that I know relatively little about the rest of the world, especially the West.
1568116467576754178 2022-09-09 05:57:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @johanstrauss90 My experience with all that has always been different from whatever the heck is going on in the US/EU, because of how explicitly logical and utilitarian China's energy policymaking is.  I have no idea how I'd have turned out if I started my career elsewhere. Probably badly.
1568115844944924672 2022-09-09 05:55:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Discourse_Stu We're all biased in some direction, based on our cultural, moral, or professional contexts, and I agree that the 100% RE maxis are also really annoying.  The nature of my work biases me more towards agnosticism, which I'm happy with, but I'm aware many could see as a fault too.
1568114855789621248 2022-09-09 05:51:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Andrei_Ilas Everyone knows that steel prices only rise when you're planning to use that steel for wind turbine construction; steel for nuclear power plants is unaffected. üôÑ
1568102567233880067 2022-09-09 05:02:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Can you spot the chart crimes and major stats error?
1568089815597608960 2022-09-09 04:12:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I wouldn't accept this summary from a junior analyst.   Seriously, I'd think there's a problem with our HR practices if we started hiring people that couldn't read charts.   https://t.co/QVUyQDZWit
1568086206235443208 2022-09-09 03:57:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shellenberger offers very little in the way of expert analysis. He's not equipped for it. At the end of the day, he's just a very loud pundit.  As a pro-nuclear guy, I'm convinced he is the one most responsible for pro-nuclear Twitter being filled with so many grating people.
1567835469278486535 2022-09-08 11:21:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc My gut instinct is that the specific group of expats that has been leaving Shanghai over the last few months are the ones that are more likely to live in the cluster of high-end apartments in that area.
1567816953880006656 2022-09-08 10:07:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 This is exactly how I feel too.
1567806626161393667 2022-09-08 09:26:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Lufeng is in Shanwei City, eastern Guangdong.  The article points out how important it is for Guangdong to bolster local generation capacity, since in 2020 it relied on sources outside the province for nearly 75% of its power generation needs.
1567806622612987906 2022-09-08 09:26:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meanwhile, Lufeng Phase I remains in purgatory.  It was supposed to have four AP1000s, but since CGN is still on the DOE Entity list, US companies are broadly barred from providing equipment to CGN.  I thought they switched to Hualong One, but seems that's still not official.
1567806617399476230 2022-09-08 09:26:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> More nuclear for China!  CGN announced today it has started construction on Lufeng Phase II nuclear plant, comprising 2x1200 MWe Hualong One reactors.  The other plants in this April announcement (Sanmen II, Haiyang II) already poured concrete back in June &amp; July, respectively.  https://t.co/Edbe55mf3x
1567437292456873984 2022-09-07 08:59:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The story in question.   When I read this, I was imagining how it would have played out in the media (and Chinese society) if Sichuan government had used smart thermostats to throttle power to residential power customers during the heat wave...   https://t.co/ygIcwPt2G1
1567435514445283330 2022-09-07 08:52:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A little case study for the role that can be played by demand reponse in shaving peaks.  Certainly nicer than the "hey my smart thermostat appears to have developed a mind of its own?!" we saw in Colorado a few days ago.  I wonder if C&amp;I power customers also participated?
1567346171903094784 2022-09-07 02:57:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece this part seems very important  https://t.co/oV9J9R0R4A
1567058435317055490 2022-09-06 07:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai @thisischaniece It is indeed sobering.  It'll be even more concerning for China when this "lost generation" is a few years further into their careers and starts to have access to real business, political, or academic leverage.
1567055804368580613 2022-09-06 07:43:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai @thisischaniece Certainly the rest of pro-China twitter is doing their part tooü§™
1567055172953870336 2022-09-06 07:40:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai @thisischaniece (I know the title sounds more elevated than that, but I think this is basically still an early-career junior researcher type position.)
1567054907852886019 2022-09-06 07:39:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai @thisischaniece That's why I didn't have any interest in dragging her. There's nothing to be gained from harassing a misguided 20-something researcher.  But I was concerned that potential Chn learners could end up misinformed, thinking they have to go to TW to learn "real" grammar".
1567053658776555520 2022-09-06 07:34:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece @rsnshanghai I don't think there was conspiratorial malice intended here. These kinds of (mistaken) beliefs are very common for a generation of young people in HK.  She was probably shocked by the backlash (not just from pro-China people, but Chinese scholars and even TW'ese themselves).
1566737851232178176 2022-09-05 10:39:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @uncle_hello Well you know, it's something "people say" apparently. üôÑ
1566736637622886401 2022-09-05 10:34:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ItamarWaksman You know I was actually wondering about whether that would be the case when I wrote this, but I didn't personally know enough about the influences (if any) of Hokkien/Minnan on TW Mandarin to make comments. Glad you mentioned it.
1566711076921942016 2022-09-05 08:53:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HAPPY889123 Thank you for the kind words!

1566671407903571968 2022-09-05 06:15:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @georginechikchi Indeed. There are many angles from which to critique that take...
1566668139211128834 2022-09-05 06:02:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rsnshanghai @ZichenWanghere As my audience on here has grown, (and includes a lot of people from my industry) I'm less inclined to make aggressive or spiteful attacks on dumb tweets, and try more often to give them the benefit of the doubt. But I'm really struggling here.
1566651332072800256 2022-09-05 04:55:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JackBHAFM At the risk of annoying your friends, yes. I went through a period where I was trying to learn a bunch and insert them into daily life and my friends were like wtf is wrong with you. Stop.
1566648844892381185 2022-09-05 04:46:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Thrasybulos Heh that has some logic to it
1566648642362122240 2022-09-05 04:45:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina I'd say so. Although that still means China gov't docs are awful. I read enough of them and you'll never catch me defending them lol
1566644625599008770 2022-09-05 04:29:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I guess she might be talking about language used in gov't documents? It is indeed stiff, verbose, and  unpleasant to read. But it's not dissimilar to formal gov't-speak in other countries.  And who learns language from policy documents, or expects literary excellence from them?
1566644621912199168 2022-09-05 04:29:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you're non-Chinese interested in learning Mandarin, you can safety ignore this. You won't learn weak/bad grammar by learning CN in the Mainland.  There are some differences, but you'll be learning things only used by a minority of CN speakers. The functional value is poor.
1566368752861859840 2022-09-04 10:13:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course, the final sentence of the post delivers this charming dose of smugness like only a China Watcher knows how, combined with an oh-so subtle ÊèêÈÜí (or reminder) that the ‰ΩúËÄÖ (or writer) knows ‰∏≠Êñá (or Chinese).  ü§Æ  https://t.co/O3vamoOm7U
1566368746532655105 2022-09-04 10:13:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By this logic, we'd be seeing a new Chinese leader every few years then? Since they'd keep resigning every time there's a drought or flood?  Thank goodness China has modern, logical humans with the mental capacity to attribute weather to climate patterns, not "cosmic forces," eh?
1566368742258638849 2022-09-04 10:13:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I usually ignore this kinda stuff because it just doesn't impact me.  But I thought it was especially egregious to drag ancient political philosophy into a discourse about the modern political impact of climate-change enhanced natural disasters. The fantasizing is so obvious.  https://t.co/kgY4QFMpQV
1566368731059875840 2022-09-04 10:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Posts like this are less about advancing meaningful discussion, and more about trying to show off that you're an Expert China Understander.  It's just empty puffery for a credulous audience that doesn't know better (while exposing you to your more sophisticated audience).
1566368726957826049 2022-09-04 10:13:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But even if it wasn't already a raging clich√©, it's just dubious to drag it into modern Chinese politics.  Yes, there is a place for it, and it IS a topic of discussion in modern CN political philosophy, but in a MUCH more subtle and nuanced way:  https://t.co/wMS1cPAjQZ
1566368714538483712 2022-09-04 10:12:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So yes, according to that logic, if a leader upset the cosmic forces with poor rule, they would be beset by calamities until replaced by a ruler who was more fit.  During the Xi era in particular, this has become very popular for a certain kind of China Watcher to salivate over.
1566368710868504576 2022-09-04 10:12:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, Mandate of Heaven is something you learn about after 1-2 yrs of China studies.  It's the belief in ancient times that a CN leader is subject to the judgment of cosmic forces and rules at their pleasure, until they do something to piss them off.

1566368703775907841 2022-09-04 10:12:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the CN business space, the most popular ones to talk about are "guanxi" and "tianming"  Force-insertion of all kinds of Eastern philosophy into Western business management materials has been going on since at least the 80s.  Somehow this trend still has legs today.  https://t.co/fjxJlxgryh
1566368695991287808 2022-09-04 10:12:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (China is hardly the only country where this happens of course.  I recall a few weeks ago where a Western guy tweeted a "guide" to a bunch of Japanese cultural concepts and got dragged hard in the replies for his Orientalized caricatures. Same thing really.)
1566368692807827456 2022-09-04 10:12:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You have to be very careful about how you use these concepts when doing analysis for modern China. You need to take care to not exoticize or even fetishize cultural concepts like this.  Besides being a form of very annoying Orientalism, it's usually also off-base or just wrong.
1566368689582374913 2022-09-04 10:12:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You might have heard people talk about "guanxi" or "tianxia" or "tianming" before. These are all real words and real concepts with significance in ancient or modern China, and you should indeed learn about these concepts to know more about China.  BUT.

1564566255667146752 2022-08-30 10:50:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sichuan peak load is now at 48GW, down from 65GW.

1564566253632888832 2022-08-30 10:50:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to the report, Sichuan load continued to drop all week thanks to cooler weather, enough to allow power supply to be restored to all industry.  Over the past week, daily residential power consumption dropped by ~200GWh while industry consumption increased by the same.
1564566250134839296 2022-08-30 10:50:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Great news! As of 4PM today, Sichuan media is reporting full power supply has been restored to ALL power users in Sichuan and Chongqing.

1564230287768580097 2022-08-29 12:35:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...and Sichuan's grid will remain vulnerable to demand spikes as long as hydro is underperforming. Fortunately, the forecast calls for more cool weather.  But still impossible to restore supply to all industrial uses, until it rains like it's supposed to...  This is a start:  https://t.co/ksa13qusqQ
1564230279132508161 2022-08-29 12:35:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have heard nothing about Chongqing, so I assume power supply is still very tight there, and that industrial power usage has not been restored.  The cooler weather brings relief for peak demand, but daily consumption is likely still tight...
1564230273226899457 2022-08-29 12:35:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also, thanks to some rain, hydropower production was back up to 460 GWh/day, from a low point of just 422 GWh. However, the rivers are still greatly depleted vs. last year (recall that daily production was 900 GWh at this time last year). So it's still shaky for sure.
1564230270555156480 2022-08-29 12:35:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This partial resumption of supply has been made possible by cooler temperatures across central and eastern China, brinking peak demand down by 12GW in Sichuan (a 52% reduction in AC demand).  Besides peak, daily residential power consumption also decreased from 473GWh to 340 GWh.

I believe there is only one small hydropower plant? So I admit it doesn't tell the whole story, although it is technically true that 95% of the power is from renewables.
1563257342040612864 2022-08-26 20:09:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CoalFreeDave Yeah, I guess it's not too hard to figure out why I'd have hydro and its potential vulnerability to droughts on the brain...üòê  Will look forward to those stats when they're available.

1563252423455830016 2022-08-26 19:49:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CoalFreeDave Yes indeed!  Alternative answer: this is a list of countries especially exposed to the increased frequency of extreme weather events in the future...most specifically droughts.
1563250341340418048 2022-08-26 19:41:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Mostly yes, although a few are geothermal or biomass. But all are 95%+ renewable energy.
1563249710902935552 2022-08-26 19:39:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CoalFreeDave Yes sir! Or very close. My cutoff point was 95%+ renewables.

1563249183871873025 2022-08-26 19:37:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AdriaanHilbers Over 95% in fact! That was much quicker than I expected - nicely done.

1562363894123085824 2022-08-24 08:59:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's a Xinhua piece talking about it. Besides bringing Xinjiang wind/solar to Sichuan and Chongqing, there will also be a Chengdu to Chongqing UHV AC line upgrade, raising their mutual transmission capacity from 6GW in 2020 to 11GW by 2025.   https://t.co/AH8ojZlosr
1562363889538727936 2022-08-24 08:59:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the topic of increased grid connectivity:  There are actually two UHV lines in the works from NW China to SW China:  Zhundong --&gt; Chengdu UHV DC (under construction) and Hami --&gt; Chongqing UHV DC (planned before 2025)  So this is how you get diversity of supply in Sichuan.  https://t.co/t4P3vc6AIb
1562307686678806530 2022-08-24 05:15:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @slyowusu No, I think my wording is more accurate and professional.

1562297072807997446 2022-08-24 04:33:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 21. The coal related shortages last year brought us huge changes in the form of a massive power sector reform package.  I think we're going to see big investment/reform decisions triggered this time as well. While I don't like the way it happened, I like that it's happening.
1562297069972656131 2022-08-24 04:33:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 20. Sichuan (and to a lesser extent, the rest of SW and central CN) can't rely on extreme weather like this remaining a once in 60 years event.   Perhaps they must now design power systems around something like this happening every 10-15 years and increase resilience accordingly.
1562297067456045056 2022-08-24 04:33:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 19. In the end the approach will probably involve a little bit of all of the above. More capacity to provide firm backup, more transmission infrastructure to provide options, slightly more cost-reflective power prices in markets..  Diversifying the solution reduces risk exposure.
1562297064771719168 2022-08-24 04:33:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 18. But this method also has its limitations, since CN is wary of allowing power prices to rise uncontrollably, especially for residential users.  The optics of residential power customers struggling to cool their homes and being crushed by power prices like in EUR is very bad.
1562297062175428609 2022-08-24 04:33:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 17. Another solution: more aggressive reform for wholesale power markets so that supply shortages reflect more quickly and accurately on power users' costs, prompting them to change their consumption behavior.  This can definitely help to reduce loads in a more market-driven way.
1562297059444936704 2022-08-24 04:33:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16. But again, the question is: how much usage would these lines get under normal circumstances?  Both Gansu and Sichuan are usually net exporters and don't import power. We're gonna build a 1000km UHV line to be used a few times a year + once every 15 years during a drought?
1562297056919797760 2022-08-24 04:33:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15. Another answer is: build more transmission lines.   This certainly can't hurt, especially if we connect those transmission lines to places that are likely to have available power when local capacity underperforms. Like...Gansu and its vast volumes of wind and solar.
1562297053241540609 2022-08-24 04:33:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14. One answer is: "build more capacity," but then what kind of capacity are we building and how is the rate of return?  This capacity wouldn't be used for long periods, months or years, especially when Sichuan has its rainy season and is oversupplied. How can it make money?
1562297050724966402 2022-08-24 04:33:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13. And finally....broader lessons from all this?  Well first, this is an extreme outlier weather event, no doubt. But that doesn't mean we can't try to design around it. Sichuan has been revealed to be overexposed to a serious drought. What could help that?
1562297047054974977 2022-08-24 04:33:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12. That means we'll continue to see curbs on industrial power demand for some time, with the impact continuing to cascade down to dams in central China (e.g. Three Gorrges) and importers in eastern China (e.g. Zhejiang). This will take weeks or months to get back to normal.  https://t.co/GK3Y7xy9CQ
1562297041271029766 2022-08-24 04:33:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11. Going forward, the weather is looking like it's finally going to ease a bit. We might have turned a corner on the heat wave, which will provide some relief on the load end, but the hydro levels are still going to remain depleted for some time. We need rain, and a LOT of it.  https://t.co/yDXRUzw8dH
1562297031947067392 2022-08-24 04:33:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10. When it comes to residential and commercial power, they have been affected less. In some rural counties in northeast Sichuan, residential power has been subjected to rolling blackouts. That suggest to me that local dams aren't generating and distribution grids are overloaded.  https://t.co/oG7uEQ2JKa
1562297025970212864 2022-08-24 04:33:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9. Even now, it's not clear if Sichuan's grid company has declared force majeure and stopped exporting power to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, etc. These are gov't to gov't agreements, and they'll be negotiated and resolved at that level, confidentially.  https://t.co/imSOgIyCRu
1562297019322212352 2022-08-24 04:33:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8. So then we get to the transmission question. Sichuan does have connections to other provinces, but they are almost all intended for power EXPORTS, not imports. Those long-distance UHV lines connect to places that need Sichuan power, and the contracts aren't easy to get out of.
1562297016193282054 2022-08-24 04:33:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7. Sichuan's 18GW of coal plants provide a bit of backup support, but they are insufficient to make up for the loss of so much hydropower generation. Sichuan's renewable capacity is even smaller due to poor wind speeds and weak solar irradiance.  The generation just isn't there.  https://t.co/5VXxaxMoya
1562297010744868867 2022-08-24 04:33:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. Now take this poor hydro production and combine it with a heat wave. Power demand spikes, and reservoir levels decrease even faster than usual, thanks to evaporation.  Suddenly, Sichuan can't meet peak demand OR daily power consumption. Which is why industrial loads were cut.  https://t.co/H1CS81FZqZ
1562297003954307074 2022-08-24 04:33:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. So when Sichuan media reports that their 94GW of hydro is only producing 450GWh/day (or 13.5 TWh/month on avg.) we get a feel for how bad hydro production really is right now.  It's about one-third to one-half of what it normally is, or just around 20% of nameplate capacity.  https://t.co/MHiZWLZhwY
1562296997998383104 2022-08-24 04:33:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. During this time of year (the rainy season), Sichuan would normally operate its 94GW of hydro plants almost constantly and might even have controlled discharge to avoid spillover (i.e. wastage).  See chart below. Normally Sichuan hydro would produce 40-45 TWh/month right now.  https://t.co/8i4OoAJtVN
1562296986015248384 2022-08-24 04:33:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. It's important to understand how hydropower operates here.  Unless it's peak rainy season, hydro normally won't and can't operate 24/7 at 100% nameplate. Hydropower's performance is limited by how rapidly its reservoir can be refilled by the river that services it.  https://t.co/n8X267QWRu
1562296977475661826 2022-08-24 04:33:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. The one-two punch of poor rainfall/drought + high temperatures has raised power demand while reducing hydropower's ability to produce at high capacity.  Low rainfall + high evaporation rates means water is replenished in hydro reservoirs very slowly, just as demand rises.

1562254142198153218 2022-08-24 01:43:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JorritGosens Thanks for the heads up - I had mislabeled liters when I meant cubic meters.  Believe the math was alright though. 75M liters = 75,000 cubic meters = 8 seconds of Three Gorges flowthrough (currently about 10,000 cubic meters/sec according to the chart I posted up in the thread)
1562253603364286464 2022-08-24 01:40:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (I deleted the prior tweet where I mislabeled cubic meters as liters. Sorry...posted at 3AM. The eight seconds calculation is still accurate though, as Three Gorges currently sees flow-through of about 10,000 cubic meters/second.)
1562252969563004929 2022-08-24 01:38:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to World Nuclear, a 1GW nuclear plant needs ~75,000 cubic meters of water/ day for cooling (75M liters)  That's *eight seconds* of water at the flow rate exiting the Three Gorges reservoir last week, even @ current depleted state of the Yangtze.   https://t.co/kzUSMJUQQz
1562170990947631106 2022-08-23 20:12:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jordanschnyc @alexludoboyd @niubi I despise this. I have to post screenshots of news stories from Chinese media or else the engagements are completed nuked.
1562155937221472256 2022-08-23 19:12:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlisonW @RealSexyCyborg That's where technology like cooling towers come into play. There are nuke and coal plants deployed along rivers all around the world, so that's not exactly an insurmountable obstacle, more like something to be designed around.
1562144521080963072 2022-08-23 18:27:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlisonW @RealSexyCyborg Yes indeed. But also remember that while nuclear uses a bit more water than coal-fired power, they're actually in comparable ranges.  AFAIK Sichuan coal-fired power is still operating, which means they're still getting enough water, even now.
1562143736741904385 2022-08-23 18:24:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also I think smaller rivers would be more vulnerable(?)  For instance, look what I found for the site of Sichuan's proposed nuclear plant, the Sanba NPP. I think this site would have been in trouble for water, if it was actually built.   https://t.co/P9tkHO90hV
1562143734544072704 2022-08-23 18:24:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So if coal plants are still securing enough water to operate, it's not crazy to guess that nuclear, if it existed at the same site as the coal plant, would be ok as well.  Again, I know, yes, nuclear uses a bit more water, so if it's right on the margin, it WOULD be a problem.
1562143732497252352 2022-08-23 18:24:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In very extreme droughts, nuclear would indeed be hurt along with hydro (and coal too for that matter).  But remember Sichuan's coal plants are still operating right now (nuclear uses a bit more water but it's roughly comparable).So we're not quite there yet.
1562143729989074944 2022-08-23 18:24:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Heyy. So. Re: Comments about water  There's a lot of space between "damn, our hydro's performance is really taking a hit" and "wow we don't even have enough water in the river to operate nuke/ coal plants"  See ouput from Three Gorges. That's still a lot.  https://t.co/k4ZBJvMFir
1562136857462571008 2022-08-23 17:57:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlisonW @RealSexyCyborg Well...I did a little sleuthing and it turns out that the Sanba Nuclear Plant, if it hadn't been postponed and had actually been built in its proposed location along the Jialing River in Nanchong, would be non-operational today.

1562126293680128000 2022-08-23 17:15:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SharminiFernan3 Today China has 54 operating nuclear units, with 23 under construction, 24 approved and in the pre-construction phase (environmental reports and stuff like that) and another 64 (that I know of) in the early planning stages.
1562124971228667904 2022-08-23 17:09:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlisonW @RealSexyCyborg But yes you're right. In a very severe drought, EVERYTHING relying on flowing water would become unavailable.  Water needs would be specific to a certain site, so I dunno if theoretical nuke plants (that don't exist yet) in Sichuan would be able to operate today.üßê
1562124309883387904 2022-08-23 17:07:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlisonW @RealSexyCyborg I'm seeing a lot of comments about water, and while I won't respond to every one individually, I'll just mention that there's a lot of space between a drought where hydropower output is badly affected, and a drought where nuclear or coal plants can't get enough water at all.
1562122772481966080 2022-08-23 17:01:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jsnlm For instance, this 2009 research. In their drought scenario, hydro was badly affected while other generation types that relied on water (nuclear &amp; coal) were ok.  But they point out in the same study that more severe droughts will indeed impact nuclear.üòë  https://t.co/1uTFTScABQ
1562121896891940865 2022-08-23 16:57:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jsnlm In more mild drought conditions, hydro output will see a decrease in output while while nuclear would still have enough water.  But yeah, at the point when rivers completely dry up, (severe drought) nuclear, coal &amp; hydro alike are all going to be affected, no getting around that.
1562056107618476032 2022-08-23 12:36:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DeepShort7 @AMFChina It's not in Fulda's area of experience or credibility to comment on climate change, or decarbonization, or definitely Chinese decarbonization. Anyway, he will never believe, but frankly what he believes doesn't matter anyway, because China not does need his approval.
1562021956458688517 2022-08-23 10:20:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything Yes the "what if our once every 100 years event becomes once every 10 or 5 years?" is a real issue for grid and capacity planning for sure. But that's the challenge China has to face with its still-growing economy and rising power demand in 2022.
1562019980408807430 2022-08-23 10:12:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything But the attractive options for firm backup supply in Sichuan and other inland regions are so limited...,  The logic will probably go "how do we make sure our plant can survive up to a once every XXX years drought?" And then try to make sure it's more resilent than the hydro.
1562018812425211906 2022-08-23 10:08:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything Indeed. I expect there will be a difference in design considerations when it is known the plant is intended to be used in regions more susceptible to droughts than older generations of plants.  The recent experience from France will undoubtedly have key case study value.
1562005504687509504 2022-08-23 09:15:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WildPixels maybe @6point626 has more resources/information on what kind of programs or initiatives are in place to reduce/reuse/recycle water at NPPs and make them more suitable for deployment in drought-prone areas?
1562005076713312256 2022-08-23 09:13:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WildPixels They do (a lot of it) although different plant design choices could reduce how much is needed. If the nuclear is being built partially out of concern for droughts, I imagine those design choices would be a top consideration.  But to be honest, it's not an area I know a lot about.

They would never use imported coal, as it is a landlocked province far inland.
1561613261040017408 2022-08-22 07:16:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's 2022 and people STILL think hydropower induced power shortages caused by a drought in Western China is related to banning Australian coal imports two years ago. I'm going to lose my mind.

Why wouldn't you put out a joint statement with your Chinese partners to ensure that current and future customers + generic public have closure and awareness?
1559483305535623168 2022-08-16 10:12:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Atomicrod Indeed...not to mention the losses caused by power curbs to industry in Guangdong last fall driven by poor coal margins.  I wonder how many facilities could have kept operating normally at that time if Guangdong's grid company had an extra 1.5GW of nuke power to work with?
1559476285403168768 2022-08-16 09:44:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Atomicrod Nothing on the Chinese side, but it turns out that EDF has put out some info, that I didn't do a very good job of finding and had to add onto the thread later:   https://t.co/igEH9maLDX

1559475292045209600 2022-08-16 09:40:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ah it looks like it WAS announced but very low key.  Apparently EDF will be "changing the way the fuel rods are held in place". So it seems like a design fix should prevent reoccurence. Good news for the EPR.  Screenshot taken from:  https://t.co/R8YhfQA7gY  https://t.co/YhiEwYRhNA

1559471813960552448 2022-08-16 09:27:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The specific NNSA summary note with the juicy details on the plant's issues appears to be ÂõΩÊ†∏ÂÆâÂèë„Äî2022„Äï138Âè∑.  Although it is referred to in the most recent announcement (148Âè∑), it hasn't been made public yet, and it's not up on the NNSA publication website right now:  https://t.co/L9oipl3uCs
1559471809409720320 2022-08-16 09:27:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unfortunately the note doesn't provide details on what caused the fuel failure and whether any modifications were made to Areva's design, just that they were two minor events (Level 0) including an unplanned shutdown, and that the operator has taken appropriate safety actions.
1559471806901551107 2022-08-16 09:27:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Big news for CN nuclear.  Taishan Unit 1 is finally restarting, after going into an early refueling outage last year to check out cracked fuel rods.

1559450307922636801 2022-08-16 08:01:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And that's even assuming the weather forecast is reliable (haaaaaaah)  As long as supply is tight, Sichuan's industry is going to see power curbs, especially power-intensive industries.  Any manufacturers exposed out there should expect to take a hit.  -End
1559450305045331968 2022-08-16 08:01:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And frankly, I don't see how this suddenly gets better on the 20th, unless there's some cure I'm not thinking of.  The key issue here appears to be the heat, and the Chengdu forecast says it's not going to let up until the 24th, although that rain could bring cooler weather too.  https://t.co/o1OH09nshH
1559450300570021888 2022-08-16 08:01:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So.  That is how you get industrial power cuts during peak hours in Sichuan  *Although on paper it seems like they have local installed generation capacity more than 2x their peak load level.*  As usual, industry will take the hit to ensure that residential power is maintained.
1559450297059385345 2022-08-16 08:01:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...oh and don't forget some hydro is already contracted for export (e.g. Baihetan UHV)  So 90GW of Sichuan hydro capacity maybe only has ~30GW available right now(?)  With just 18GW of coal and &lt;10GW of wind/solar/biomass on top of that, 60GW peak load becomes a problem!  https://t.co/ySW5Ar61R6
1559450290444992513 2022-08-16 08:01:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to Sichuan's provincial government, rainfall upstream of their key dams is down by 40% vs. the same period last year.   So we have 1) Decreased water supply and 2) Faster evaporation.  The hydropower plants must be producing at...what? 30-40% of nameplate? And dropping.  https://t.co/rlBWjVz3hF
1559450284782661640 2022-08-16 08:01:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Susceptibility to droughts is one of the lesser-discussed drawbacks of hydropower, but it has asserted its existence this year, and not just in China.  Scientific research focused on modeling hydro performance under future climate shifts is a hot topic  https://t.co/W6dsJH0yvR
1559450281834082304 2022-08-16 08:01:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And this has been a particularly hot, dry summer across central China, causing rivers/reservoirs/lakes to evaporate, which reduces water flow for hydropower generation  Almost everywhere in CN is drying up right now (Yunnan perhaps a notable exception).   https://t.co/9BdhTpQg7B
1559450277220319232 2022-08-16 08:01:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> While I am not a hydrology expert, it's not too technically demanding to infer that sustained hot/dry weather leads to reduced hydro output.  China's hydro plants see ~40% load factors on an annual average, indicating huge disparities in output between the wet &amp; dry seasons.
1559450274494058496 2022-08-16 08:01:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides hydro, Sichuan has just 18GW of thermal capacity &amp; fairly small amounts of solar, wind, and biomass.  Meanwhile, cooling demand led peak load to set 6 new records this month and is expected to hit 60GW.  (I believe this press release has a typo and says GWh but means GW).  https://t.co/C02QlNpHu9
1559450269376999424 2022-08-16 08:01:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For starters, among all Chinese provinces, Sichuan is one of the most exposed to seasonal or weather-related variance in hydropower production.  According to State Grid, hydropower is ~77.5% of the installed capacity in the province, or around 93GW of its ~120GW total.  https://t.co/jehHOMZeOR
1559450262787731457 2022-08-16 08:01:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On Sunday, Sichuan announced power rationing measures lasting thru the 20th. But I think it could last a bit longer.  Reasons for the power shortage include poor hydro production &amp; persistent high temperatures. ü•µ  What's going on?üßµ(reposted to fix a broken link)  https://t.co/Cu3gelZSkP

1559130942119510021 2022-08-15 10:52:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16% YoY spike in domestic coal production in July.  Now pair that with a corresponding drop in coal imports (down 11% YoY in Q2, not shown in this table).  Conclusion: CN increasingly seeking to decouple itself from int'l coal markets &amp; exposure to the volatility they represent.
1559122796403638272 2022-08-15 10:20:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq I wonder how much power demand was already being curbed in July 2021...

1557972164447715328 2022-08-12 06:08:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker It'll be hard to quantify "before" and "after" on a fair playing field, of course, because of the damper effect that covid has had on most kinds of international collaboration...
1557971688184496128 2022-08-12 06:06:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @richbrubaker It's too early to say of course, but I predict not only the working partnerships and programs that were functioninig well and creating the most value will continue on like nothing has changed, but organizations below the national level will continue forming new relationships too.
1557970545547051008 2022-08-12 06:01:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tobitac I would credit international NGOs with more credit here. Orgs like NRDC, WRI, Greenpeace, etc. have been super active working with CN universities and think tanks to put more green policies for the BRI in front of policymakers.  Fortunately I expect all of that would continue.
1557970117128241152 2022-08-12 05:59:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tobitac As for the BRI...a lot of highest-level progress has been made over several years in "greening the BRI", even in the sometimes near-total absence of any kind of functional diplomacy between the USA and China. I think that will continue.   https://t.co/SCkQ9r4wn7
1557969518743687175 2022-08-12 05:57:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tobitac It's paywalled :/  I think the idea of China supporting and contributing to B3W projects is like China buying Russian nuclear reactors. Do they NEED to? No...but maybe it served a useful IR/political lubrication function. Otherwise, why wouldn't they just do the same via BRI?
1557965067840536576 2022-08-12 05:39:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I agree with that. In a different time, in a happier geopolitical environment, "ending cooperation on climate change" would have felt like a real blow to progress, and could have been working via the mechanism you described.  But today I don't care enough to be upset about it.
1557959377541562368 2022-08-12 05:17:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gwbstr Who's in that camp exactly? USA right wing?
1557959192304316417 2022-08-12 05:16:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gwbstr First. I can't believe I could have been using the ‚â† sign when I've been wasting characters all this time typing =/=.  Second. Hmm interesting. I have more experience with the "our relationship should be competition, not cooperation" camp than the "climate off the table" camp.
1557955653016354816 2022-08-12 05:02:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Maybe others disagree &amp; think real damage has been done but I just don't see it.  I'd say the Paris Agreemment was the last big example of the US and China cooperating to make more substantial policy commitments than they would have individually. And how has that gone?
1557955650239741953 2022-08-12 05:02:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Am I too cynical here?  If the US &amp; China "stop cooperating" on climate change, what changes?   Does critical research get defunded? Do professors stop writing papers together? Do joint ventures dissolve?  I think "cooperation" is a political word like "not cooperation" is now.
1557943555506974720 2022-08-12 04:14:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @srblhk While "competition" may be the theme of the relationship going forward, I think it falls into the trap of assuming that everything China does is a response, reaction to, or interaction with the USA.  Which I don't agree with. China's first priority is China.
1557929511236550657 2022-08-12 03:18:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BN9195 @JChengWSJ @joshrogin Well if it could be demonstrated to me that China and the US cooperating on climate change made 1+1=3, then I'd agree it's a loss. But I don't think that's been true for any climate-related policies or programming since...what? The Paris Agreement?
1557927592933871616 2022-08-12 03:10:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JChengWSJ @joshrogin "Climate change cooperation" has been little more than a symbolic gesture of "look how we're getting along".  "Ending" climate change cooperation, therefore, is a symbolic gesture of "now we're not getting along".  It doesn't change anyone's actions or programs on either side.
1557666683233652737 2022-08-11 09:54:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Yeah when I was a kid, I'm pretty sure we couldn't swim at the community pool when it started raining. I thought that was normal everywhere?

1557647432833724416 2022-08-11 08:37:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @riceparktrees Adding to that, China can   1. Mine more coal to increase domestic supply, and probably more importantly  2. Order state-owned coal-fired generators to operate at a loss in the event of expensive coal prices, to avoid power prices rising too much.
1557646985792200704 2022-08-11 08:35:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @riceparktrees I'd assume that their energy mix is constructed in such a way that leaves them over-exposed to thermal fuels when the renewables aren't performing. So when thermal fuel prices rise unprecedentedly (like they are now) power prices rise too.  That my lazy 20 second analysis anyway.

1557580559425359872 2022-08-11 04:11:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @biangbiangren Gas could serve that ramping function best from a tech perspective, sure, but it's also the most expensive fuel available in CN. With exposure to int'l markets and instability of supply, developers are probably even more scared of poor ROI than they are for coal. A guess anyway.

Is it the Chinese speakers with the same shared delusion, or the non-speakers? ü§î
1556940721445564421 2022-08-09 09:49:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> btw if you're in the Mainland and want to take advantage of cheaper flights out of HK, you can take a ferry from SZ to HKIA and leave without entering HK.  Does anyone know if the ferry is still running in the other direction from HKIA-SZ? Information online is oddly...blank.
1556940718622806016 2022-08-09 09:49:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hmm, so I just bought a HK-NYC roundtrip flight next month for 8500 RMB (!)  That's a bit more expensive than pre-Covid, but at least is in the realm of normalcy.  By contrast, a roundtrip flight from SH-NYC for the same dates costs like 50,000 RMB.

1555204183460298752 2022-08-04 14:49:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @andrey_enright Yeah that's right. If they weren't previously buying power through a wholesale market channel already, they have a grace period to secure a wholesale power supplier. During that grace period, the grid will keep supplying them power from the "last resort" power pool.

Those have no costs to dispatch as they don't use fuel.  Coal on the other hand, costs money. You only run the coal plant after you've used up capacity from the cheaper options:   https://t.co/V3vKbXee9y

You can build 1000s of GWs of solar and wind and still run into this problem...  https://t.co/4omeGcF78J

Basically, you build capacity that you won't use a lot of, because you'll only need it for a small part of the day. Why? Because of all that variable solar and wind needs firm backup.

1554402082039697408 2022-08-02 09:41:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mtaylor_nz Oh btw in case it was puzzling, the first three columns are in units of 10,000 MWs, so 135 = 1.35GW.  The fact that Chinese has dedicated words for 10K and 100M accounts for 98% of the number-related mistranslations in non-Chinese media, including mine.
1554399092599816193 2022-08-02 09:29:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mtaylor_nz Yep that's right. Developer, project size, project type, and then type of storage installed, size of storage, etc.
1554370493524090880 2022-08-02 07:36:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LaoshiChu @pplsartofwar I've only been to Nan Xiang once but I think I remember it was good, just touristy. My favorite place in SH is Ëé±Ëé±Â∞èÁ¨º.
1554362540284837888 2022-08-02 07:04:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ravinaproject Same story in Gansu right now, although at least they have some industrial load that can move the demand around a bit to better take advantage of the solar (and a sufficiently large coal base for daytime ramping)   https://t.co/4omeGcF78J
1554361940218376193 2022-08-02 07:02:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ravinaproject Frankly I think we're going to see spiking curtailment rates in XJ until new transmission and flex resources come online. Developers are probably going to take a bath for a few years while waiting for new UHV lines to carry the power somewhere it's actually needed.
1554354230701731840 2022-08-02 06:31:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NuryVittachi Thanks for providing your platform to republish this Nury! Your edits are crisp and I think it works better as an essay than it did as a thread anyway.
1554322571033997312 2022-08-02 04:25:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pplsartofwar I think I would be a fan of Ding Tai Fung if I lived anywhere but Shanghai
1554310211498049536 2022-08-02 03:36:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda Frankly, SOEs like profits just as much as private industry...and they're usually expected to try to be profitable. They're just not allowed to be TOO profitable, and they're not supposed to complain if some policy doesn't allow them to be profitable üòâ
1554308096977436672 2022-08-02 03:28:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Alan_S_Drake Heck, in two years from 2009-2010, we saw 13 reactors pour first concrete. The long-term stated goal is to be breaking ground on 8 new reactors a year, every year. I'm sure there is an upper limit in the supply chain, regulatory, and HR, but they're not at it right now.
1554307167666470913 2022-08-02 03:24:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Alan_S_Drake The restrictions and capabilities of the US fleet and industry are a poor proxy for understanding China's current construction, supply chain, and regulatory capacities.  The industry here is capable of supporting at least 5-6 FCDs a year but we just aren't seeing those rates.
1554305601286832128 2022-08-02 03:18:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang jesus man that's a grim progression

1554162078650626048 2022-08-01 17:48:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nomad779 In the future, maybe I'll stick to what I know and you stick to what you know, cause this sure isn't your lane.  https://t.co/kKGZobRSJJ
1554158205894524928 2022-08-01 17:32:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SylvainRGignac Yeah, it's common across the country now, since last year. Usually between 5-20% of project nameplate capacity, for 2 or 4 or (sometimes) 8 hours
1554069616967979008 2022-08-01 11:40:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Source on the 40GW Xinjiang batch today:   https://t.co/sjnoRydLLP  Inner Mongolia also announed 11.88 GW today:   https://t.co/FrbiHezVhd  -End
1554069613386014720 2022-08-01 11:40:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because I don't subscribe to that "RE or nuclear?" debate, and neither do most Chinese energy economists and policymakers. The correct answer is "both", and that's what China is planning to build.  I'm very keen to see the nuclear plants ramp up the way RE has.
1554069605978898433 2022-08-01 11:40:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To encourage developers to finish these 40GW of projects before the end of the year, there's a capital loan interest reduction scheme.  But this perk disappears if you don't grid connect your project's full capacity before the end of the year (or 80% for large projects).  https://t.co/uyxTFDzULU
1554069596550086656 2022-08-01 11:40:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course, according to XJ policy, these new solar/wind projects must be accompanied by storage to firm up supply side reliability. 6.9GW total, mostly for 4 hours.  Most developers are opting to use batteries, although a few are also using thermal storage (molten salts).  https://t.co/MBbjYYkpu9
1554069588442480640 2022-08-01 11:40:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Amazing example: Today Xinjiang released the results for its second batch of project allocations for 2022.  38 developers were approved to build 40.6GW of wind/solar capacity across 66 sites.  That's just ONE region, for ONE of its batches of projects this year. Huge numbers.  https://t.co/psplHfhzXI
1554069574794227712 2022-08-01 11:40:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Earlier this year, I was even on Bloomberg basically saying: "I want to believe it, but...you gotta do it ONCE, before I'll believe that you can keep it up for three decades."  Guys. They're doing it.  In this new normal of 2022, 72GW of wind/solar capacity = 2-3 provinces.
1554069571325562882 2022-08-01 11:40:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For CN to meet its future power demand growth via renewables only, (no new coal after 2025) models say it NEEDS to add 120+GW this year, next year, &amp; every year, for 30 years. They can't, the lights go out.  When CN added 72GW in 2021, it was a new record  So 120GW+ seemed..hard.
1554069567504527360 2022-08-01 11:40:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's just crazy how massive the wind and solar installs in China are this year.  I know it's not really a big secret that "no one is talking about" or something, but something to emphasize is that these huge numbers are also necessary. üßµ   https://t.co/Bl8B5I5PVw
1554036424374030336 2022-08-01 09:28:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DellacroceAl Considering China's HSR is among the safest in the world, I think you'll be waiting a while. You may pass the time waiting by crying and fuming, etc.   https://t.co/KUS4ForDvb
1554034227838328837 2022-08-01 09:20:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @0Buk0wsky @DellacroceAl Two fatal accidents in 14 years (Wenzhou 2011, Guizhou 2022) is an excellent safety record, considering the hundreds of millions of passengers carried over that period.  Probably the only country with a better HSR safety record is Japan? And they have a much smaller network.
1553974063307292672 2022-08-01 05:21:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @feilipu0628 @DanielOlimac Oh yeah that's definitely an upgrade over the sleeper berths in older generation D trains. I haven't been on one for probably 8 years.
1553969778733502464 2022-08-01 05:04:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @feilipu0628 @DanielOlimac The overnight D trains are so strange...they're like sleeper cars...but not really? There's two levels of beds that three people have to share? Or that's what I remember from back in the day anyway
1553968142644580353 2022-08-01 04:57:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @feilipu0628 @DanielOlimac Mmm Beijing to Nanjing overnight...is that the old T65/66? I took that one a few nights while studying in Nanjing.
1553964070487085056 2022-08-01 04:41:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Also depends on the textbook. My first year and a half I used Integrated Chinese which was fine I guess, but then when studying abroad we used New Practical Chinese Reader which I felt was a stronger (but less "fun") textbook series.
1553963254732705793 2022-08-01 04:38:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Damn that's a lot...usually it's like 150 characters by end of semester one and maybe 450 by end of semester 2? That's what I seem to remember
1553958663639146497 2022-08-01 04:19:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 The issue with "recognition" is that you still won't know the compound words they form  Like just because I know "brow" and "beat" doesn't mean I know what "browbeat" means. I could 'read' a newspaper after a year or two of Chinese, but had no idea what was going on...üôÑ
1553933485613920257 2022-08-01 02:39:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScarrottKalani Ah, jJudging by the kms they gave to China in 2006, it looks like they also gave credit for those rail acceleration efforts that improved speed on some of the older rails to 200kph +
1553826153873690624 2022-07-31 19:33:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @oreo_g I bet they were broken within a few months...or weeks...or days...
1553824419189239808 2022-07-31 19:26:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Eh...apparently this route had computer stations on the trains at its birth??  Has anyone ever seen or used these?  I've never seen this carriage layout. Look how large those windows are, and the width of the aisle! Old school.  https://t.co/CcYyLubNp0
1553824412541276160 2022-07-31 19:26:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Technically China had already broken the 200kph threshold (a common definition for HSR) via acceleration on existing lines, but this was the first purpose-built high speed railway, equivalent to service on modern G trains.  August 1, 2008: 117 km  January 1, 2022: 40,000+ km
1553824408950931456 2022-07-31 19:26:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh, happy birthday to China's modern High-Speed Rail.  On this day in 2008, the 117km Beijing-Tianjin intercity 350kph CRH route formally opened for business.  The first train was C2275, departing from the brand-new Beijing South Station (also celebrating its 14th birthday today)  https://t.co/Tt3tgU00jN

1553678686490345472 2022-07-31 09:47:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman It was SO COLD at the top. Everyone had to rent a jacket for like 30 RMB to wear so you wouldn't freeze while waiting for the sunrise. They had racks of them waiting for tourists...an entire mountaintop covered with people running around in green chinese military jackets.

1551839541010796545 2022-07-26 07:59:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sunnybloke @solar Yes absolutely. Gansu has several long distance UHVDC lines planned to start construction this year or next, although they won't be able to play any role until about 2027. We see these low daytime prices (and unfortunately, rising curtailment rates) in Gansu before then.

1551542756920930304 2022-07-25 12:19:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ptrebor Generators are now required to install some storage together with their wind or solar for newbuild in most places in China.  End-user storage is still uneconomical in most places (although when power prices are 0 it would make sense, it's unclear how long this will last).
1551512431473864704 2022-07-25 10:19:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TheStalwart Seems like there's not much room for demand response in that market? If the power is being curtailed, it would be quite cheap I'd think.  Check out, for example, how some Chinese industrial power users are taking advantage of cheap solar:   https://t.co/sgB2elVHmo
1551511615975346176 2022-07-25 10:16:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going forward, entire industries will want to calc the cost-benefit of migrating their power demand to times of the day when power is cheaper, especially if they are located in energy-rich provinces where the differential is so large.  I wonder what this means for lunch breaks?üßê
1551511613769121792 2022-07-25 10:16:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When it comes to beating solar curtailment in CN, we used to focus on flexible capacity, (e.g. storage) T&amp;D investments (e.g. UHV lines) or control of supply growth (stop building).  The launch of RE in the spot market now highlights the major role demand response can play too.
1551511611596505088 2022-07-25 10:16:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And why is power so cheap between the hours of 12-3pm?  Well, that's the time when Gansu solar power is cranking at max capacity, creating major oversupply.  West Gansu has some of the best solar irradiance in the nation - up to 1800 hours/annum, and they're adding tons of it.
1551511609478361089 2022-07-25 10:16:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The answer is that yellow line. Gansu is so oversupplied with power between 12pm-3pm that it's basically free.  So, industrial power users shifted their load to that time to take advantage of the cheap/free power.  700-800MW of load has shifted, ~5% of peak demand.
1551511607150518274 2022-07-25 10:16:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As you can see, the average 24h power load profile changed quite a lot in Gansu from Jan 2021 to Jan 2022.  The 2021 peak load of 16.5GW used to come in the evening, around 7pm, but in 2022, the peak load has moved entirely, now arriving around 12-1pm instead . What happened?
1551511604172562432 2022-07-25 10:16:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A solar power chart that says a thousand words!  What are we looking at?  The red and blue lines are the average 24hour power load curves of Gansu Province, in Western China.  The dotted yellow line is the price of power in the day-ahead power market (i.e. the spot power market).  https://t.co/OY0zP6cy5j
1551479992835768321 2022-07-25 08:10:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman Nice! That's how I've been finding slightly less well known but still very compelling attractions that aren't totally swamped with people...  (if you happen to be a geography nerd, like me, it's also fun to use it just to learn the smaller cities in a province)
1551392145289781249 2022-07-25 02:21:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman I've been going on Ctrip, searching the province, choosing the 4th or 5th most popular city from the slider, and then looking through its top attractions for 4A or 5A attractions far from the city center.
1551249930970624000 2022-07-24 16:56:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck @ZichenWanghere @doumenzi Nah it was good. It was slightly stinky but not ovewhelming.  Like if you told me it's fresh fish I'd be like whoaaa i'm not eating that, it's spoiled! But as Ëá≠È≥úÈ±º it was üëç
1551240879788019714 2022-07-24 16:20:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere @doumenzi My lunch today :)  https://t.co/vPMmdfgLBh
1551239611233751040 2022-07-24 16:15:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @StoneCh00365833 @doumenzi Oh yeah, for sure. I just mean that it's not easy to find in other cities, which feels...not appropriate for a so-called ‚ÄúÂ§ßËèúÁ≥ª‚Äù
1551237224045645824 2022-07-24 16:05:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xuchuanmei I read this thing once about how there's really only ËãèÂåó and ËãèÂçó &amp; the people in Yangzhou/Taizhou/Nantong invented "Ëãè‰∏≠" because they didn't want to be associated with those poor cities in ËãèÂåó.  I asked my Nantong colleague and she was like "no! we'd never! well...maybe..."
1551229372707008512 2022-07-24 15:34:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @doumenzi The one that surprsies me more than Anhui is Fujian.  At least you can find a few Anhui restaurants in other cities...lol
1551225409429446656 2022-07-24 15:18:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything Yeah I bet it's much better now, although you still often run into issues, especially in the bigger eastern cities farther from buddhist populations. You can always try telling people you can only eat the same things buddhist monks eat and they might get it?
1551223426182168576 2022-07-24 15:10:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck I'm gonna hire you to fact check any tweet I have in the future that even remotely touches on history
1551221009797492737 2022-07-24 15:01:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Yeah I've felt the cultural line in southern jiangsu that happens when you cross between zhenjiang and changzhou. As soon as they switch from nanjing/jianghuai mandarin to Wu dialect, the food, culture etc. also change.  My Chinese history is a pretty significant weak spot.
1551217953139736576 2022-07-24 14:49:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Important update! The line of demarcation for Huaiyang cuisine should be farther north, as the name implies cities (Huai'an + Yangzhou) in central Jiangsu, already north of the Yangtze.  So maybe the border is like...between Huai'an and Xuzhou (?)   https://t.co/wx1iXFhIXD
1551216903502561280 2022-07-24 14:45:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Hmm yes you're right. The dividing line should be farther north than the Yangtze then? Somewhere between Yangzhou and northern Jiangsu (like Xuzhou), the food switches to be more like Shandong style, but I don't know where the exact spot is.
1551209743699824640 2022-07-24 14:16:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat>  https://t.co/cfggNYhtuR
1551209592893632513 2022-07-24 14:16:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. The snubbing of Xibei food (Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, etc.) and Yunnan (or Yun-Gui) is just crazy.  7. Eat what you like. These lists were made up for marketing and are kinda sus anyway.
1551209590347694080 2022-07-24 14:16:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. Dongbei food is awesome of course and I think it's more bias to minimize it as an offshoot of Shandong cuisine instead of its own thing.  If Jiangsu and Zhejiang can be considered unique from each other, Shandong and Dongbei should too!
1551209588099543041 2022-07-24 14:16:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. Most classic "BJ food" came from somewhere else, especially Shandong and Inner Mongolia. Beijing duck is based on a Nanjing dish.  4. I think the only reason Jiangsu &amp; Zhejiang are both in the list of 8 is southern bias. They have a LOT of overlap (and with SH too).
1551209585792655360 2022-07-24 14:15:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Trying to match a single style of food to modern provincial lines is often futile.  e.g. northern Jiangsu food is more like Shandong food, northern Guangdong food is more spicy like Hunan food, anywhere in Zhejiang/Fujian/Guangdong with Hakka people will be different, etc.
1551209583469019136 2022-07-24 14:15:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back during the Qing, it was simpler.   4 Great Cuisines, based on geographic regions:  North of Yangtze = Shandong  South of Yangtze = Huaiyang (basically the Yangtze River Delta) South = Guangdong Center/West = Sichuan  (Fun fact: I used to moonlight as a food tour guide in SH)
1551209580553981952 2022-07-24 14:15:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay the Big 8 are Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan, so the correct answer was C.  Just 27% of you got it. üëÄ  Comments:  1. As one reply pointed out, the "8 Great Cuisines" is a recent invention, in a People's Daily article from 1980.

1550886476283789312 2022-07-23 16:52:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aixliugs Nah you don't get to bust out an "well akshually" with a smirk and then accuse others of arrogance when they response negatively to your toxic attitude. Educated trolls are still trolls, and you fit the bill perfectly. Hope you aren't like this in real life.
1550883492200087552 2022-07-23 16:40:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonm223 Looks like Lishi is a district, not a prefecture-level city.   https://t.co/sTg1VnLcJx  I have issued a correction re the population size though; it's 5th smallest:   https://t.co/Wp26qp0LRa
1550878586764394497 2022-07-23 16:20:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As long as you're here, why not take a quiz to test your knowledge about the OTHER great Chinese cuisines? (besides Anhui)   https://t.co/z2zKPDVuYO
1550876841195761664 2022-07-23 16:13:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I spent a slightly-embarassing amount of time on choosing answers that would make this as tricky as possible (tricky IMO anyway). üòÅ  I'll post the answers later, but let's see what the collective wisdom of Twitter thinks first. RT if you want to see more data.
1550875074101940224 2022-07-23 16:06:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Quiz Time!   In traditional Chinese culinary theory, there are 8 Great Culinary Traditions ÂÖ´Â§ßËèúÁ≥ª  Which of the following sets of cuisines only includes cuisines that ARE part of the Big 8?  (i.e. there are no impostor cuisines hiding among the Greats)  No cheatingüòâ
1550865891365367808 2022-07-23 15:30:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck We'll get it tomorrow. I've had it before at restaurants in other cities and didn't enjoy it but I'm willing to give it another try now that we're in its place of origin.  I also discovered today that I've been pronouncing È≥úÈ±º wrongly for years. ü§¶
1550865047735668736 2022-07-23 15:26:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xuchuanmei Yeah I think among those that don't like tofu, many find the texture unpleasant. I like regular tofu, firm and soft both, but this was...something else hah
1550860165842288640 2022-07-23 15:07:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is crispy rice ÈîÖÂ∑¥.  It's made by roasting cooked rice on the bottom of a  wok-shaped iron pot so it gets very crispy, then flipping it over and pouring a savory sauce with vegetables and Ê¢ÖÂπ≤Ëèú over top. It's hollow inside.  This was *very* good.  https://t.co/1cwolD1VSm
1550860154844770304 2022-07-23 15:07:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I also appreciate that you can get some relatively uncommon local vegetables here in Huangshan. Or at least they aren't common on menus I usually see.   È∏≠ÊùøËèúÔºå ÁÉßÁ¨ãËòëËèáÔºåÁÅµËäùËèúÔºå ÈáéÊûúË±ÜËÖê  https://t.co/9ZXXLoBhFD
1550860123110662144 2022-07-23 15:07:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This one is definitely not for everyone. It's ÊØõË±ÜËÖê...a fermented tofu with an very mushy, almost gooey interior. Much more of a challenge than stinky tofu.   I thought it was interesting...didn't hate it but didn't like it enough to order it again. Texture very off-putting.  https://t.co/1bGCvVCQkU
1550860104806719488 2022-07-23 15:07:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anhui cuisine stays pretty low-key, for being one of the 8 Great Culinary Traditions.  But yes, it slaps. And I'm very glad for a change of pace after weeks of heavy, oily, spicy Hubei and Hunan food.   Here's a few tweets of appreciation.  Á¨ãÂπ≤ÁÉßËÇâ and ÈÖíÁ≥üÈ±º.  https://t.co/qdFoTEDyuz
1550832114546790405 2022-07-23 13:16:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @brenda11831 I was just thinking...If it was worth covering 2 years ago when something bad happened, isn't it worth covering again now to find out if the situation is better? Same? Worse? They report bad stuff, which is fine...But then NEVER close the loop, so that's all you can find on it.
1550778392886525952 2022-07-23 09:42:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After weeks of hotels making me input eight 8's for the WiFi password, I gotta say it's a real breath of fresh air to a get a good ol' fashioned 1-8 for a change.
1550697538902462465 2022-07-23 04:21:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing There are a lot of ways in which less-sophisticated rural dwellers can get screwed over in these kinds of development plans...and while laws exist to protect them, enforcement is always another issue.
1550697209850916865 2022-07-23 04:20:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing Unfortunately what often happens I think is they lease the land from rural residents (urbanites don't have land usage rights themselves) under a long-term contract that seems good at the time but looks exploitative in 5 or 10 years when the area is more developed.
1550662012694212608 2022-07-23 02:00:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @hotelzululima @CurtExplores @AndyBxxx Chang'An Avenue seems to handle them okay?  Unless they're also constantly repairing that too. They probablya are. It always looks new.
1550656951088218112 2022-07-23 01:40:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Case in point:  Writing about CN but not covering EVERY ASPECT means risking a smug China Knower parachuting into your mentions, missing the key point, demanding you address his favorite topic, and insinuating you skipped it intentionally.  https://t.co/FxO7xkSBXR
1550651394109370368 2022-07-23 01:17:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @postmodern3 I'm sorry I missed your favorite topic in my 50-tweet thread about something else.  Thanks for helping demonstrate this point really vividly though:  https://t.co/KDOw9lvJoY
1550517115735908352 2022-07-22 16:24:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ji34381503 By defensive I meant preparing extra material to response to potential comments or critiques before they come.  But yeah I also have low tolerance for people who seem like they're just looking for a fight. I'm liberal with my mute/block button.
1550510840230854657 2022-07-22 15:59:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @iamvarun Mmm yes. That makes sense.
1550506536866557953 2022-07-22 15:42:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ElectionNyc Yeah the Ezhou-Xianning highway is only about 10 months old and since most of the exit ramps aren't usable yet, I don't think it gets much traffic.

I'm sure it has a proper name...Jiangnan rural house style. But those look a little more modern/updated architecturally.
1550500657651929088 2022-07-22 15:18:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything Kudos on all of that! I'll think more on it...
1550500481302396928 2022-07-22 15:18:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Vollnuss2 That's how I've been convincing myself so far - that if I do a good job making the individual tweets punchy, then people won't mind the length. But if I'm being honest with myself, I would very rarely be willing to read a thread as long as the ones I've been writing...üòÖ
1550499270184546305 2022-07-22 15:13:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TypischTelstar Thanks~  What happens when you make a mistake is keyboard warriors screenshot it and then paste it with "this you?" into your mentions until the earth stops spinning and the sun burns out üôÉ
1550498414206795776 2022-07-22 15:10:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jerometenk Irrespective of SCS politics, it used to be administered as a county-level city and I remember was a whole Thing when it was upgraded to a prefecture level city instead, so I should have recalled it on that basis.
1550497102874443779 2022-07-22 15:04:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aixliugs What's "problematic?"  I didn't make that up to sound clever or something. If you knew it, you're still in the very small minority. Don't be a twerp.  I have issued a correction note re: the population - fair play on that. Bad research.   https://t.co/z6thvzG59b
1550495091076497409 2022-07-22 14:56:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Crap.
1550494360751738885 2022-07-22 14:53:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *Correction* I consulted bad info. Having done more research, I found Ezhou is 5th-smallest, not THE smallest.  2021 census:  Ezhou: 1.06M Sanya: 1.03M Haikou: 1.01M Wuhai: 558K Sansha: 2.5k (should have thought of this)  Also Sansha has the smallest area. Ezhou is 2nd-smallest.

1550480592621678592 2022-07-22 13:59:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geoeverything Ahhhh maybe someday. It's a very daunting concept though.
1550476977706254338 2022-07-22 13:44:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jerometenk @kristenelooney Yes Professor Looney's name came up several times being quoted in the (scant) coverage that these programs have received in non-Chinese media. Keen to see the results of that scholarship.
1550476198970437632 2022-07-22 13:41:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But I admit another reason is my long-winded style..  There are somany details I think are cool &amp; struggle to trim them. I wish tweets could have like...footnotes...so the main content keeps moving but there's also a space for side details.  What works for this? Substack? Medium?
1550476197175275523 2022-07-22 13:41:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm realizing how writing about China on Twitter conditions you to write defensively.  One reason my threads are getting longer is I'm trying to anticipate and pre-empt all the ways someone could accuse me of leaving out part of the story or missing some context.

1550300846222905345 2022-07-22 02:04:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blob_watcher Counterpoint: Miles Cheong.
1550299990647787520 2022-07-22 02:01:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *to add to this thought, I suppose semi-rural areas at the edge of medium/small cities are still likely to be assimilated into growing cities. It's not like urbanization has stopped, obviously. It's just the focus on urban areas to the total exclusion of rural areas has shifted.
1550297913879920641 2022-07-22 01:53:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 and that's why I said MOST üòâ
1550297372097658881 2022-07-22 01:51:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman Yeah, the "ÂüéÂ∏ÇËßÑÂàíÂå∫". I read about those too. Supposedly compensation levels for destroyed houses on the edge of cities are better (?) than the rural rejuvenation projects. But still many opportunities for graft...
1550295892590477312 2022-07-22 01:45:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *subsiSTING, not subsIDING*  Confused myself by saying "subsist on subsidies" hahhhhh
1550294708605558784 2022-07-22 01:40:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> P.S. I would like to acknowledge the work of post-doc researcher Xu Hongzhang at ANU, whose paper on this topic was super valuable for info sourcing and organizing my ideas in this thread.  Read it here:   https://t.co/OQ6BcmTxGX
1550294701898891264 2022-07-22 01:40:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8. Overall, I support the balanced urban/rural model embodied by New Countryside, even if some of the execution has issues.  China is far from the only country experiencing rural withering. Most can't implement a policy exactly like this, but there are lessons here.
1550294698459561984 2022-07-22 01:40:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7. They're just a few years into a plan that will take 3 decades. There's time to figure out what's working, what's not, &amp; make changes - and I believe they will (for what they think are problems anyway).  e.g. I think more systems for ensuring rural rights are still needed.
1550294694986665984 2022-07-22 01:40:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. As with everything everywhere, IT'S COMPLEX. In this program's ideals, realities, successes &amp; failures, everyone will find something to like...and dislike.  But anyone who tries to give you an opinion on it without ACKNOWLEDGING the complexities is doing you a disservice.
1550294691501211648 2022-07-22 01:40:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. As with everything in China, decentralized execution creates opportunities for local bad actors to take advantage.  If only 1% of local developers/officials are rotten, that's still millions that are harmed, even as other hundreds of millions benefit.  (It's more than 1%)
1550294686841307137 2022-07-22 01:40:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. New Countryside, just like the construction of other new infrastructure in China (no matter whether it's dams, highways, or railways) means someone's house is getting wrecked.  Sometimes this is a windfall for the owner. Other times it's a burden &amp; material/emotional loss.
1550294683427180544 2022-07-22 01:40:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. In some ways they look like a village version of centrally-planned cities. If you build it, they will come.  But this means the rural areas are competing to retain/attract the same people that small cities like Jishou are also targeting. Can both fill up? There will be waste..
1550294679786504192 2022-07-22 01:40:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Rural areas in China will not die out &amp; only live in museums.  Nor will they all seal themselves in amber, waiting for urban residents to play disney farmpark.  They are trying to fabricate a linked urban-rural structure for 21st century China, a model I find very compelling.
1550294676141637632 2022-07-22 01:40:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. The period of China championing urbanization at the expense of rural areas is well and truly over. The new narrative is: It is time for urban CN to repay its debt to rural CN (ÂèçÂì∫ is the common metaphor).  Poverty alleviation, New Countryside, part of this same playbook.
1550294672526168064 2022-07-22 01:40:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After my tour, I spent a few days reading as much as I could about New Countryside, trying to fill in gaps. I wish I could go back and ask more questions...and take more pics. Hindsight...  This reading + what I saw led me the following list of summary thoughts and conclusions:
1550294665790095360 2022-07-22 01:40:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "We didn't have any change here for twenty years," Liu  says. "Just a little bit maybe. Almost the same as when I was a kid. Then in the last two years, Taihe has changed more than all the time before. Our Chinese countryside is a beautiful countryside now."  https://t.co/d7ZSALNr7Z
1550294655828643840 2022-07-22 01:40:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> All told, Brother Liu spent 3 hours taking us on this bizarre and unique tour of Taihe. We see more examples of new infrastructure, public services, planned tourist sites, guesthouses, &amp; agricultural communes. Most totally empty.  "As a Taihe resident, is it a big change?" I ask.  https://t.co/AewxCbwP4d
1550294647788171264 2022-07-22 01:40:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Who's paying for all this?" I ask. "Is the money coming from Ezhou City? Hubei Province?"  "Hah, where would Ezhou City get the money? This is from the government."  "You mean from Beijing?" "Yeah, Beijing. It's all the government's money"
1550294643547729920 2022-07-22 01:40:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The village ends and the new road abruptly changes to an old cracked one. I see the last street lamp. The houses are old and rundown.  "That's the end of our New Countyside" Liu says. Over there is Daye City. They aren't doing New Countryside yet."  https://t.co/dFWg2VJL1f
1550294633410105344 2022-07-22 01:40:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Are people happy with the new infrastructure? Are they happy to have new houses? Do they miss the old village style?"  "Some people are happy. Some people miss working in the fields.. They're nostalgic &amp; they have no other activities to stay busy...nowhere to raise chickens."  https://t.co/kwNjHLRIKA
1550294624815939584 2022-07-22 01:40:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "And this will be an art village. We will have guesthouses with an art theme, so people can come and enjoy the countryside, do art, and raise vegetables".   "Is it working?"  "I don't know. It's not done yet. First we'll build the roads and businesses, and then we'll see."  https://t.co/y9L9us1zeP
1550294613873000449 2022-07-22 01:40:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Really? What about jobs?" I ask. There aren't any jobs."  "There will be jobs too. I'll show you". We arrive at a collection of buildings with field plots in a neat design.  "This will be an agricultural commune. People from the city can come here to grow vegetables".  https://t.co/HGrpfri3nI
1550294603525664769 2022-07-22 01:40:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Look here" says Liu, pointing to a Rural Health Services Station. "This is New Countryside"  "There", pointing to a new public toilet. "New Countryside".  "But there's no one here to use it!" I protest. "Why bother?" "Once we build these things, people will want to live here".  https://t.co/B9pO8G3AJG
1550294592431751168 2022-07-22 01:40:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Most of the farming here is with machines now." says Brother Liu.  "There's no one here to work in fields. Landowners lease their land to big companies and they grow whatever they need. But the old people still like to have their own farm area for vegetables."
1550294588568776704 2022-07-22 01:40:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...that's a topic for another day. Let's go back to Taihe. Brother Liu wants to show me more places.  We cross through several more small villages, with newly-renovated houses, bridges, parks, rest benches, and street lights, all empty.  I finally see one solitary farmer.  https://t.co/2BSdszMK8p
1550294580087910400 2022-07-22 01:40:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the time, outlets like NPR &amp; SupChina gave it negative coverage, framing these programs as wasteful &amp; malicious, while the Guardian was balanced.  Earlier this year, The Diplomat checked in on the topic neutrally.  And that's it for EN media over last 3 years. A damn shame.  https://t.co/Y7VQf0twzl
1550294569606352896 2022-07-22 01:40:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It was a big deal in 2020 when L√º Dewen of Wuhan U exposed in a viral essay that rural redevelopment under New Countryside programs in Shandong were trampling on villager rights, causing inequitable outcomes &amp; poor living conditions. Even local officials admitted the issue.  https://t.co/CykN3F7zJh
1550292872502849536 2022-07-22 01:33:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (Apparently there's a common trick for dishonest developers and/or local gov't to lowball rural residents at 700 RMB/sqm specifically, based on an obsolete regulation from 2003.  There are TONS of legal videos on Chinese sites warning people about this. It's a very hot topic).  https://t.co/2Au2lXvLVV
1550292857952817153 2022-07-22 01:33:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Later I went searching online for more information about compensation. I found it varies wildly by place and situation, from 100s-1000s of RMB/sqm.  People have videos online about the question of taking the compensation cash vs. a compensation house, and how much is reasonable.  https://t.co/DNuIfN5F1M
1550292846485581824 2022-07-22 01:33:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "There are also houses built by the government on the main road, for people whose houses were destroyed because their house was too broken. They get a new apartment from the gov't, or compensation money, depending on how large it was and what material."  https://t.co/nN9YkBk2lf
1550292825757347843 2022-07-22 01:33:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "The luxury houses here are built by the villagers. It's cheap. But many of them don't live here anymore. They only use the house a few times a year, when they come back for holidays. If you see someone living in their house here, it means they are old, or don't have money".  https://t.co/DQQYm7yqPV
1550292806258032641 2022-07-22 01:33:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's quite the place. A huge tiled yard with tree, flowers, and a BBQ grill. A private fish pond in the entrance. A small temple on the first floor and a larger one on the second floor. Mahogany furniture everywhere. The most fully-equipped bathrooms I've ever seen.  https://t.co/FVrfPhrLG6
1550292769234915328 2022-07-22 01:32:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We're going to visit "the nicest house in town" according to Brother Liu. We park &amp; walk into a rural luxury villa.  "Just an old couple live here" Liu says. "Their daughter built them this house, but she lives in the city. It's our tradition, to buy a house for your parents."  https://t.co/sHcCO5LC9a
1550292737274298368 2022-07-22 01:32:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The houses are new. The road is new. There are solar-powered streetlights, roadside benches, a little park. But there are no people.  "It's just old people here, &amp; they won't come outside in the heat" Brother Liu says. "But for holidays, everyone comes home and it's very lively."  https://t.co/R8jWEtx6Qc
1550292715950448640 2022-07-22 01:32:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We arrive in a village with no more than 40 houses. The road weaves through the houses that I can touch out the window. We zoom around blind corners without vision around the turn.  "Don't worry" Brother Liu says. "No one lives here".  He's right. We see no one.  https://t.co/NkpHMmazI9
1550292658584961024 2022-07-22 01:32:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Within 5 minutes of leaving Taihe, we're hurtling along a (paved) one-lane road edged by fields of corn.  I'm surprised to see rideshare e-bikes parked on the road, 2-3 different competing brands, the same as in Ezhou City. Brother Liu says the e-bikes cover all the villages now.  https://t.co/CJalzjBduI
1550292647558148096 2022-07-22 01:32:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now it's time for the tour.  It turns out Brother Liu is so enthusiastic about the New Countryside projects in Taihe Township because: A. He's from here and B. He's a manager in a paving company that won many tenders to fix the rural roads.   He's very proud and keen to show me.  https://t.co/o7Mhf3Kltb
1550292628570243073 2022-07-22 01:32:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We arrive in Brother Liu's hometown, which is Taihe Township Â§™ÂíåÈïá, population 56k. It's a mess of trikes, motorcycles, and construction vehicles honking horns.  True to his promise, we get beef noodles w/ youtiao for breakfast. They're OK. I tell him they're delicious.  https://t.co/zporAtSOeS
1550292618852315136 2022-07-22 01:32:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So Sat. morning, we're up early, boarding Brother Liu's massive new Ford SUV, speeding off to Liangzihu, a rural district of Ezhou about 60km away.  We take the E'Xian Highway, which is so new that half the exits don't work.  We are flanked by endless plots of lotus ponds.  https://t.co/BXAq5uRilP
1550292606638510080 2022-07-22 01:32:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After dinner, I mention to the relevant family members that I'd like if someone could tactfully chat up Brother Liu tomorrow (when he's not plastered) to figure out if he was just being polite, or if he'd actually be willing to take us to see the New Countryside?  And he was!
1550292603249524737 2022-07-22 01:32:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most of us never go to the real CN countryside. And that includes me. By "real" I mean the places *without* pretty towns, canyons, or rivers for tourism.  The only time we see these places is @ 300kph from the window of a train. 500M live here.  So...I'm VERY keen to go see.  https://t.co/1LRoC44gId
1550292593774559232 2022-07-22 01:32:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This urban-rural model stands in obvious contrast to models where almost everything is urbanized and rural life exists only in musuems.  ...or models where rural areas stop developing by design, existing as an anachronistic farm disneyland, subsiding on tourism &amp; subsidies.  https://t.co/XjBTOfb6UH
1550292586002534400 2022-07-22 01:32:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A frequent linked phrase is "Rural Rejuvenation." ÂÜúÊùëÊåØÂÖ¥  In theory, the endgame of "rural rejuvenation" is a China where large cities, small cities, &amp; rural areas all have comparable services &amp; infrastructure, offering attractive but different lifestyles. The deadline: 2050.  https://t.co/YYrER5kvz2
1550292574719852545 2022-07-22 01:32:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China's New Countryside Êñ∞ÂÜúÊùë initiative has formally been going since 2018, although before it had a different name with similar aims.  It is a massive, nation-wide, long-term project trying to reinvent rural lifestyles &amp; reverse the trend of rural decline, or "withering".  https://t.co/3jdrNQn4Gl
1550292565366538240 2022-07-22 01:32:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have no intention of going and he has no intention of following through. This is all ÊÑèÊÄùÊÑèÊÄù But of course I agree, because that's what you do.  Then he says the magic words: "When you come, I will take you to tour our New Countryside projects.  Ohhh. Now I really DO wanna go.
1550292562271154176 2022-07-22 01:32:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The first night, out to dinner, a family member has invited his business partner. The guy is thick, tall, &amp; crushing the baijiu.   His face is red. He is loud and excited. He wants me to come to his hometown to eat beef noodles for breakfast. They're the 'best noodles in Ezhou.'
1550292559062532096 2022-07-22 01:32:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I will talk more about Ezhou in a second thread. Because, despite its unimpressive characteristics, this seemingly-boring city has a bright future, thanks to some killer new infrastructure.  But first, let me talk about Brother Liu and Ezhou's New Countyside.
1550292555761618945 2022-07-22 01:32:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ezhou is a small, bland city of a million souls on the Yangtze, just southeast of Wuhan, close enough to commute (23 mins to Wuhan via high speed rail).  It is the SMALLEST prefecture-level city in China, both in population &amp; area. Virtually no one outside of Hubei knows it.  https://t.co/8DNFLCYxTi
1550292538736918528 2022-07-22 01:31:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What is China's "New Countryside?" Why is it so important? Can it actually work?  In my quest for answers to those questions, I found myself deep in the tiniest villages of Ezhou, in Hubei.  Never heard of Ezhou? (ÈÑÇÂ∑û) Don't worry, few have.  Time for a long thread üßµ
1549980248170647553 2022-07-21 04:51:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu I like these, but I'm not sure I need them to make a cola
1549648719427309568 2022-07-20 06:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I can honestly think of no way to make anti-science fearmongering more offensive than callously cross-breeding it with this style of insincere, performative culture discourse.
1549630270818889729 2022-07-20 05:40:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JaredTNelson @chris__pc I think he's just adding the population of every province that has any kind of lockdown?  So lockdown of 750k in a county in Anhui becomes lockdown of all 62M people in Anhui.  That's the only way to get to those numbers as far as I can see...
1549330584715296768 2022-07-19 09:49:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonwakter lol nice one @simonwakter  https://t.co/qD3pkKfzYz
1549326715725676545 2022-07-19 09:34:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonwakter Maybe they're gonna plant it entirely with potatoes, then use the potatoes to grow more potatoes, a la Matt Damon in The Martian, and then 4 generations of potatoes later be able to feed 2000 households with all the accumulated potatoes
1549217814216867840 2022-07-19 02:21:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Ospero79 @Fuquar1 @RealSexyCyborg @sdbaral @slainv_fr I have this theory of causality where people with bad takes are constantly being condescended to by others, which conditions them to be condescending too.  But I'm willing to accept that both bad takes and condescension could simply be correlated and are caused by being a moron.
1549206883466362880 2022-07-19 01:37:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 coffeezilla has a few good takedown videos of him
1549202533285269505 2022-07-19 01:20:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IanJohnBuckley That's pretty standard in public bathrooms here too
1549199776583139328 2022-07-19 01:09:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @savageyongary This villa actually had two bathrooms like this. The second one had a "squatty potty" step installed under the toilet step so you could recreate that "anatomically correct" posture. I believe it's for elderly. But this one didn't have it.

1548974311746449416 2022-07-18 10:13:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy OH and see how many dead-end plotlines you can count. It's a whole meme online, tracking Yellowstone's forgotten plot lines, abandoned characters, and seeming chekhov guns with no payoff. It's like they have 6 hyperactive kids writing plotlines.
1548973990311792640 2022-07-18 10:12:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy It's very entertaining but the poor writing starts to wear on you after a few seasons. The dialogue is fine, but the character writing is super inconsistent.
1548813229740007424 2022-07-17 23:33:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sufw Oh look out we gotta comedian ;)
1548689055474667520 2022-07-17 15:20:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So if your main concern was the morality issue, I say go, pay the stinkin' company their stinkin' ticket price, and then spend 5x as much on drinking and dining and souvenirs inside, to the direct benefit of the villagers whose livelihoods now depend on it.
1548689052572188672 2022-07-17 15:20:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course it totally sucks that a rich investment firm put you in that position; you can't spend money inside &amp; support the village economy and unless you pay a greedy company their pound of flesh at the door.üôÑ  But your "moral boycott" only makes it even tougher on the locals.
1548689049397112832 2022-07-17 15:20:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. On the other hand, if your concern is MORAL equity, and you want to boycott the attraction on those grounds, I'd invite you to rethink.  The loss of your individual tourist revenue means almost nothing to the investment company, but means everything to locals like Boss Xiao.
1548689046192660480 2022-07-17 15:20:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Lots of places in China have this problem of over-commercialization, maybe ruining what are otherwise wonderful sites. It's similar here.   The scenery wasn't ruined for me and I still found a way to enjoy it. For others, it would be too much.  (Don't go during golden week tho)
1548689043097255937 2022-07-17 15:20:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Addendum:   Quite a few people have been asking in the replies whether I would still recommend going to Furong. Here are my thoughts on that:  1. If you would be turned off by the heavy commercialization, the ? for YOU is whether the scenery is good enough to balance it out.
1548684083286659072 2022-07-17 15:00:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wtruszczynska I've been thinking about whether I could recommend it and here's what I decided:   https://t.co/kkzOYmQs1m
1548681435946823680 2022-07-17 14:50:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew And yeah the super athletic old ladies sprinting ahead of you to the top to offer you cool drinks is almost a given in China.  Boss Xiao told me they have "basket backpacks" to carry tourist children as well. Would have LOVED to see that lol.
1548681062867673089 2022-07-17 14:48:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew Yeah I was doing all kinds of things wrong...unprepared, wrong shoes, in a rush, no map. I didn't even have breakfast. I honestly thought it would be a nice nature walk and I'd be back in an hour.
1548672979386900480 2022-07-17 14:16:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew At the time I quit, I was probably 15 minutes from the top (and the exit) but my ticket map was all wet and unreadable. It was actually even more dangerous to go back down the slippery path but I did it like a moron.
1548672268259463170 2022-07-17 14:13:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew ouch lol  Actually I had a train to catch too.  I was being extra dumb and didn't realize that the exit is at the top of the canyon, &amp; that I would arrive at a village at the top and could hire transpo from there. So I thought I had to backtrack to exit, which would take time. ü§¶
1548644249087791104 2022-07-17 12:22:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mknezevi I'd definitely advise staying at the place I did, across the river. It's called Sun Sui Guesthouse Ê≤≥Ë•ø‰∏äÊ†ñÊ∞ëÂÆø  And if you go into the village, you must avoid peak hours and tour groups (so go in the morning).  And check the canyon I just posted too.
1548643881603850242 2022-07-17 12:20:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mknezevi Well...It's still pretty, even with all the commercialization. I don't wanna say don't go there at all, because that just robs the locals of their income, to punish a giant investment company that won't notice your absence at all. So just go and spend a lot of money inside.
1548637053922861056 2022-07-17 11:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence To serve as a useful landmark when trying to describe where you live.   "Up on aomen road. You know it"   "Oh like one street up from the apartment with the fake mountain?"  "Yeah exactly"
1548634439428685824 2022-07-17 11:43:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Part 2 of Furong:   https://t.co/oUcGFsOCoL
1548632243807358976 2022-07-17 11:34:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's a standard that I think was common 30 years for many top attractions that have 4A or 5A today like Huangshan or Zhangjiajie, before they installed plank paths and fences and cable cars and snack bars.  If you end up going to Furong area, it's worth your time.  -End  https://t.co/IdDxywwl4b
1548632192330637313 2022-07-17 11:34:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And its underdeveloped infrastructure probably has to do with the fact that it's 100% owned and operated by local Guzhang County government, with no outside investment, and they have no money to invest in upgrading it.
1548632188895506436 2022-07-17 11:34:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> All things considered, Zuolong Canyon is a great option for young, healthy, physically capable people to explore. And you need hiking shoes and gloves.  It's only a 3A attraction, but I think that has more to do with its undeveloped infrastructure, not the quality of its scenery.
1548632184072052737 2022-07-17 11:34:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Zuolong Canyon sneaks up on you. At first I was shaking my head about the idea I might need gloves, chuckling about litigation risk.  And then I was scaling a wet cliff, clinging to chains as my shoes slid uncontrollably across the moss, in the end turning back before the peak.  https://t.co/TYAT6lL4CO
1548632142980481026 2022-07-17 11:34:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After a few more sections of slippery stones and clinging to chains, I was done. If I had proper hiking shoes and wasn't hiking alone, I would have continued.  But I was getting images of news stories: "dumbass laowai tourist slips and dies hiking canyon solo", so I went back.  https://t.co/HnKjb5KTW1
1548632041293758464 2022-07-17 11:33:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After this, the trail got even worse.  I entered into a tight section of the canyon called the Black Crack which continued the trend of mossy slippery stone and chains, but nowwith a 5-meter drop into the rushing stream.   Then the path went up the side of the cliff on a ladder.  https://t.co/Ae80Auwm5u
1548631962164002817 2022-07-17 11:33:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Around another bend of the canyon, another small waterfall, and it's not clear where I'm supposed to go next, until I see the chains continue up straight up the side of the cliff.  Oh, I see, this is what we're doing now. Okay then.  https://t.co/VCVwv2Kw7F
1548631882946211840 2022-07-17 11:33:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have to film again at the top of the waterfall. The path to get here was tricky and a bit dangerous, but this scenery is incredible...it looks like a film set.  https://t.co/oLEVxf3Ttl
1548631257843924992 2022-07-17 11:30:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I turn a corner and the canyon suddenly widens out with a small waterfall spraying over the top of the canyon edge into a deep green pool of water below. Someone has left an inner tube floating in the pool.  I'd love to jump in, but I don't want to hike wet, so I keep going.  https://t.co/AfPbdh3A5v
1548630784789315585 2022-07-17 11:28:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Funny that I was laughing about the litigation risk of un-fenced sections of path before. Now we're clinging to chains on a a mossy rock wall over a 2-3 meter drop.  I pass the two other tourists who entered ahead of me and turn around to take some pictures for scale.  https://t.co/QaORCPetFr
1548630716136960001 2022-07-17 11:28:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Green cliffs rise up on both sides. Water drips from the mossy canyon walls and everything is now muted and damp and gurgling.  The walking path begins to elevate over the stream bed. In some places, metal plates are driven into the canyon wall to serve as steps.  https://t.co/zqDFoLrILb
1548630578832228355 2022-07-17 11:27:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The plank pathway abruptly changes to a stone path. I'm not wearing hiking shoes; these are regular runners with heavily-worn treads, so I'm slipping a bit on the water-slicked stones.  The gloves come out. I mentally apologize to auntie for thinking she scammed me.  https://t.co/b37IzAGLr0
1548630495436886016 2022-07-17 11:27:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Before long, the route changes to a series of pleasant green pools and waterfalls.  I'm laughing that I bought the gloves. Ah well, it was just 5RMB.  I take a moment to marvel how the path next to the water sometimes has no fence.  What a litigation risk in the US~  https://t.co/0uP814Vmjc
1548630362792013824 2022-07-17 11:27:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I head into the attraction. I know nothing about it, except that it's a canyon, and apparently I need gloves. Oh, and Boss Xiao says it's "a lot of fun".  It starts out as a metal/plank path along a quiet clear stream, under a canopy of fig trees.  https://t.co/PKu23I4K85
1548630248652435458 2022-07-17 11:26:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "You sure I need those?" I ask, suspicious I'm being hustled out of 5RMB.  "Oh yes" she says. "You'll be pulling yourself up on chains. Look at your hands. They are so soft and pretty. You need gloves."  I look at my hands. They do look soft and pretty.  I buy the gloves.
1548630246039375872 2022-07-17 11:26:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As I head in, a gaggle of locals near the entrance accost me and tell me I need to buy water, snacks, and gloves, or else I'll be sorry.  I understand the need for water and snacks, but why gloves?  "You'll need the gloves to hold onto the chains" the auntie tells me.
1548630242247741442 2022-07-17 11:26:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After about 35 minutes, I arrived at the entrance to the tourist attraction. There was just one small parking lot with no cars.   At 8am, I wasn't even sure it was open, but a baoan waved me over and directed me to the ticket office. They told me I was the 3rd visitor of the day.  https://t.co/tqGxCkzJ13
1548630186006319104 2022-07-17 11:26:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As I emerged from the fields and onto a larger road, a plaque informed me that I was entering a "Beautiful Countryside Demonstration Village Area."  I spotted evidence of recently-spent money, including new wells, irrgation ditches, and just-planted red flowers lining the road.  https://t.co/Ga1BEiHDuT
1548629892040110081 2022-07-17 11:25:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Although I've never been, the landscape reminded me of pictures I've seen of California wine country, with gentle rolling hills covered in low scrubby brush.  it was not quite 8am and the heat hadn't turned up yet, so my trip through the Hunan fields was mild and enjoyable.  https://t.co/9i8xUfv6gE
1548629816102232064 2022-07-17 11:24:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Putting 100% of my faith in Baidu Maps, I ended up on small winding farm paths cutting between orchards of tangerines.  Google tells me they weren't actually tangerines, but something called a pankon Ê§™Êüë, a hybrid of tangerine &amp; pomelo. They are the main ag crop here.  https://t.co/xwUTDyisXm
1548629754773131270 2022-07-17 11:24:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, based on my experience in Furong, I didn't want to give any more money to this company.  Boss Xiao suggested I check out Zuolong Canyon instead, which wasn't on my radar at all, but was only 5km away from the guesthouse. So on the morning of my last day, I hiked over.
1548629748058038272 2022-07-17 11:24:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In fact, Changsha Huaxia holds 80% of the shares of Red Stone Forest &amp; the other 20% are held personally by the firm's founder/chairwoman. I guess that makes it a 100% private attraction.  The local gov't probably had no money to develop so they leased to Huaxia?  https://t.co/OpffMumcoP
1548629738075623424 2022-07-17 11:24:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But Boss Xiao told me Red Stone Forest is developed by the same company that runs tourism at Furong Village.  I checked the corporate structure and found it's true. Red Stone Forest is one of many Hunan attractions invested in by Changsha Huaxia Investment Company.
1548629733713547264 2022-07-17 11:24:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Furong Part 2: The "Beautiful Countryside" and The Most Dangerous Canyon  After my disappointing experience with Furong Village, I needed a new attraction for the next day.  Originally, I had planned to go to the Red Stone Forest Á∫¢Áü≥Êûó a cool-looking geopark nearby...  https://t.co/fsPRfZiuFc
1548531016830435329 2022-07-17 04:52:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I don't activate the Block Chain lightly. They've gotta do something gross like say all Chinese people are animals, or advocate for dropping a nuke.  If I go down my blocklist of accounts I've blocked in this way, it's just a solid mass of HK, USA, and UA flags. e.g.:  https://t.co/O1LBi3F50u
1548530375680737280 2022-07-17 04:49:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Twitter tip: When you come across an account saying some shit like "we should nuke China", you can save yourself some grief by using Twitter Block Chain on their entire follower list before blocking them.  This charming account even had a blue-check follower! Lovely guy I'm sure.  https://t.co/bng9bKTI2v
1548525698507472896 2022-07-17 04:31:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NukeChyna It's disappointing that this was your only takeaway.
1548508528616574977 2022-07-17 03:22:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi yes yes YES
1548501778656002048 2022-07-17 02:56:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kong_ls Maybe. The owner of the private investment firm is also a Tujia ethnic minority. I bet she has some very strong local relationships.
1548501271308795904 2022-07-17 02:54:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc I could desperately use a travel partner who isn't godawful with a camera (like me). Let's figure something out and make the best damn China travel content anyone has ever seen. üòÑ
1548500912330899456 2022-07-17 02:52:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda Agreed...and the story I discovered about the development company makes me even more unlikely to return
1548480772520427521 2022-07-17 01:32:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @catmac1 Tongli in Suzhou? I've never been. But now it sounds like somewhere I wouldn't want to...unless I was writing another expos√© thread...ü§î
1548470189456752640 2022-07-17 00:50:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fins0905 It's one of the biggest things that gives me reverse culture shock when I go back to visit
1548469922820685824 2022-07-17 00:49:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @catmac1 @HarveyZZed Thanks! I think this one needed some more aggressive copy-editing though...it drags on a little too much.
1548469271738519553 2022-07-17 00:46:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After a week of 37-degree blazing heat in Hubei, today finally a change of pace...now it's ony 32 degrees and pouring rain....joy
1548466226581884928 2022-07-17 00:34:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fins0905 the portion sizes...geez
1548311347259383808 2022-07-16 14:19:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thanks for reading! This is 1/2 posts about Furong. Stick around for the 2nd, when I'll share harrowing details of literally the most dangerous tourist attraction I've ever visited in China.  And if you like this content, check out some of my other China threads.
1548311344726028288 2022-07-16 14:19:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It was my first time to see this development model in Chn, with the local gov't a minority partner to a deep-pocketed private sector investor (who maybe calls the shots too?).  I'm sure it's elsewhere, but so far I've only seen local gov't-run efforts. And so far I prefer them.
1548311342318505988 2022-07-16 14:19:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the end of the day, is it a disaster? Nah. The locals are still living well. Remember, Boss Xiao is jealous of them!  But the sleaziness of the development company made this feel this arrangement is lacking in equity for the locals, who even felt it was necessary to strike!
1548311339395067905 2022-07-16 14:19:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW I checked the Furong tourism company ownership shares.  I found it's 30% owned by local govt and 70% owned by a big SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP investment company in Changsha involved with a half-dozen Hunan tourism projects with local gov't as the minority partners. Interesting...  https://t.co/xnwvlsWmb6
1548311334508711937 2022-07-16 14:19:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> However I think I do get why they aren't getting dividends like the other villages I saw.  Unlike Dehang/Longji, their lifestyle/culture is not the tourist consumption draw here. They ARE ethnic minorities (Tujia) but this isn't ethnic tourism. Furong is famous for other things.
1548311332168298496 2022-07-16 14:19:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After hearing all that, I had some pretty mixed, and mostly negative feelings about Furong Village.  While it's clear the locals are finding ways to economically benefit from their town's fame, it mostly feels like they are helpess/involuntary passengers in this scenario.
1548311326958977024 2022-07-16 14:19:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Dunno what's up with the famous rice tofu shop.   But it was in the 1986 movie &amp; has photos of their famous diners (stars &amp; politicians) on the walls.  Including, in 1997, the Deputy Party Secretary of Fujian Province, some guy named Xi Jinping.  Their business is probably fine.  https://t.co/9iDtGZ3AzJ
1548311321015627776 2022-07-16 14:19:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to Boss Xiao, the strike was partially successful. They got the opening hours shortened to 10pm and lowered the entry fee for one neighboring county to 30RMB instead of 60RMB.  They agreed to re-open after, and it's seemingly been a cautious peace since them. Victory(?)
1548311318541004800 2022-07-16 14:19:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because the locals aren't working for the tourism company, they couldn't actually go on strike and stop the operations of the tourist zone.  But they could ensure that they are no shops, restaurants, or guesthouses for tourists to use within it. So that's what they tried to do.
1548311315638554624 2022-07-16 14:19:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...but the owners refused, cause they were happy to work &amp; make more money. In retaliation, the tourism company stopped bringing package tour groups to that shop &amp; let copycat vendors with the same product to open in the same area.  (Boss Xiao was really pissed about this one).
1548311313004511232 2022-07-16 14:19:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. Rumors of sleazy business practices. According to Boss Xiao, one very famous rice tofu restaurant was making 3M RMB a year &amp; the tourism company decided they wanted a piece of it. They offered the owners a rent of 1M a year to retire and allow the company to operate the shop..
1548311310722805762 2022-07-16 14:19:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. While residents ofc don't have to pay to enter their own village, there was no special allowance for family members coming to vist from nearby counties.  If they weren't a Furong resident, they had to pay. It was a discount (60 RMB vs. 108) but they felt it should be free.
1548311308332072961 2022-07-16 14:19:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Their complaints were as follows:  1. The residents are upset that the attraction is open &amp; selling tickets all the way until 11pm. It used to be until 8pm, after everything closed, but the operator extended the hours to stop people from entering for free. Now they can't rest.
1548311305928732672 2022-07-16 14:19:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He tells us that since last year, when the 5A rating was earned, relations have been VERY bad between the residents of Furong Village &amp; the Furong tourist development company.  In fact, last year about 300 of the shops and vendors  even called a general strike! I ask for details.
1548311301633736704 2022-07-16 14:19:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm surprised. The villages I've been to paid a % of the tickets to the locals whose lives are on display for tourists.  "But then why would they want to develop the village like this?"  "They don't" Boss Xiao says. "Actually they have conflict with the development company"
1548310559069974528 2022-07-16 14:16:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I feel the villagers of Furong have a lot of disruption to their lives though" I added. "They live inside a very busy tourist zone...there's no privacy and the loud bars are open quite late. How much do they get for their dividends? (ÂàÜÁ∫¢)‚Äù  "What dividends?" Boss Xiao asks.
1548310556335296512 2022-07-16 14:16:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So it was a little disappointing, but when Boss Xiao picked us up later, it got worse.  He asked us how it was, and we answered it was OK, but too commercial. "At least it helps the economy" I said.  "Yes, Furong is rich now" he said. "We're still poor on my side of the river..."
1548310550459072512 2022-07-16 14:16:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The waterfall and scenery and the night views of the village lit up with fairy lights were still awesome, and that's what we were there for.  We tried to focus on those and not dwell on the things that cheapened the experience.  https://t.co/juTn5ViJ2a
1548310538425634816 2022-07-16 14:16:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We walked around the village on our second day. With the exception of the waterfall itself, it was everything I hate about Chinese tourist towns.  Naggy vendors. Expensive tourist traps. Roasted sausages on a stick. Vape stores. Loud dazzling performances in fake costumes.
1548310533853835264 2022-07-16 14:16:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When Boss Xiao opened his guesthouse in 2019, Furong Village had already transformed itself into something more like a theme park with a waterfall.   Six performance shows a day. Crowds massive and growing. 200+ new buildings, doubling the town's size.  https://t.co/APxzAl3iDL
1548310472130445312 2022-07-16 14:15:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But all that changed when the Yongshun gov't got the idea to upgrade Furong Village to a 5A attraction.  A development company was established &amp; the money spigot opened up. 100s of millions of RMB were spent on upgrades. Ampitheaters, a tourist center, a waterfall trail...  https://t.co/ROfnN46l4H
1548310425401720835 2022-07-16 14:15:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From what I can gather by looking at old travel blogs, Furong Village was a smaller regional attraction for many years.  In 2012 it earned a 4A rating. There were guesthouses, a few vendors, a few teahouses. Film buffs went to check out locations from the movie (pics 2011).  https://t.co/xqcT5gSOXv
1548310414584590336 2022-07-16 14:15:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The name of Wang Town was formally changed in 2007 to match the tourist interest in the titular "Hibiscus Town" (which before that didn't actually exist anywhere in Hunan).  See the modern pic             vs. a (blurry) pic from 2010  https://t.co/imEeeksgps
1548310409060708353 2022-07-16 14:15:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...except back at the time of filming, it wasn't called Furong Village. It was called Wang Town ÁéãÊùë.   Hibiscus Town was a 1981 novel that was supposed to be set somewhere in south Hunan. The film produers chose to to film this fictional site in Wang Town for the 1986 movie.
1548310405294194689 2022-07-16 14:15:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let's get back to Furong for a second.  Originally, this village was famous for one thing: the filming location of the 3rd-gen classic Hibiscus Town ËäôËìâÈïá, a 1987 Golden Rooster Best Film/Best Actress winner including a young (and almost unrecognizable with that hair) Jiang Wen.  https://t.co/iFI2clJERj
1548310399057285122 2022-07-16 14:15:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> During normal business times, ALL the places to stay in Furong would totally sell out and the overflow demand would allow his place just across the river to book up as well.  Furong still has lots of tourists, but not quite enough for this model to work anymore.
1548310396230311936 2022-07-16 14:15:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And it shows in his online ratings. He's got a near-perfect 4.9/5 on Ctrip &amp; distinctly remembers EVERY guest that ever gave him less than 5stars (I quizzed him one evening drinking tea together).  And his service is fantastic. For 3 days, he personally chauffeured us everywhere.
1548310392635793409 2022-07-16 14:15:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Despite his dislike of the job and the industry, he's actually very good at it. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and attractive, with great views of the river.  For a small guesthouse in the Hunan countryside, a lot of thought has gone into designing these spaces.  https://t.co/m0weCLQgdB
1548310360813600768 2022-07-16 14:15:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Really, I don't like this job. But when we opened, I was too busy to think about whether I liked it. Every day...waking up early, picking up and dropping off guests, carrying luggage. My wife stood in the kitchen all day making meals. Now I am just so bored."
1548310357495914496 2022-07-16 14:15:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "All my friends say my personality has changed since I opened the guesthouse.  Before, when we went out to get beers and BBQ, if some asshole bumped into me or wanted to hit me, I would fight him. But now I just smile and say sorry....sorry...sorry...It's true...it's me now"
1548310354161442816 2022-07-16 14:15:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Actually I'm not really suited for the hospitality industry, you know? I used to have a really bad temper when I was in the army. I used to get into fights all the time. But you can't do that with guests. You have to smile, accept abuse and say "sorry....sorry...sorry".
1548310351368028161 2022-07-16 14:15:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But business is awful for Boss Xiao right now. Over 3 days in the 20-unit guesthouse, we were the ONLY guests.  "Before Covid, I got up at 5AM &amp; was so busy that I didn't have time to eat...or pee...until 2pm.".  Now he spends his days drinking tea and dreaming of other jobs.
1548310347366690816 2022-07-16 14:15:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This plot of land used to be his childhood home. As Furong tourism was picking up, he flattened it and spent all his savings to build what you see here.  The two units closer to the river (facing Furong) are for guests; his family lives in the third unit.  My balcony's view:  https://t.co/gTPoT5njAd
1548310315762614272 2022-07-16 14:15:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Boss Xiao is a local. He joined the PLA straight out of high school and stayed for 14 years.  The military doesn't pay great, but you can save literally every penny. After he got out in 2014, he worked for a few years, took all his money, and built this dream guesthouse in 2019.  https://t.co/RuH3cuFJPl
1548310290017976321 2022-07-16 14:15:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Boss Xiao is the owner of the guesthouse we stayed at while visiting Furong.  His guesthouse is not in Furong at all; it's actually on the south bank of the river, in Guzhang County.  A lot of online reviews mentioned how loud the hotels in the village are, so this seemed better.  https://t.co/QHaJHk9ZcW
1548310257709228032 2022-07-16 14:15:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But..behind all those glittering lights, Furong has some unfortunate dirty secrets. Before we get to that though, I have to talk about where I stayed, how I got around, and how I gathered info.  To do that, it's time to introduce the protagonist of my Furong story: Boss Xiao.
1548310253917601792 2022-07-16 14:15:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Furong itself looks so cool. An ancient village, built on the banks of a creek flowing down a slope into the river.  As the creek ate away at the hillside, it created several cascading waterfalls. Add colored lights &amp; walkways...BOOM. You've got the hottest attraction around.  https://t.co/ZZADxg6yZR
1548310220358963200 2022-07-16 14:14:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Furong Village ËäôËìâÈïá, also called Hibiscus Town, is a prime attraction in Yongshun, Xiangxi.  It's just two stops north of Jishou on the brand-new HSR (and one stop south of Zhangjiajie). It lies on the north bank of the Xishui River that divides Guzhang and Yongshun Counties.  https://t.co/yotFhVBwmK
1548310205666295808 2022-07-16 14:14:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Visiting a picture-perfect tourist site in Hunan - but there's trouble below the surface.  A threadüßµ  Seems every couple months, Hunan's Furong Village goes viral on social media. It's been doing this for several years, on Weibo, Douyin, even Twitter sometimes.  Easy to see why:  https://t.co/EuijF0JU8M
1548210809729601536 2022-07-16 07:39:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc 18000 PER MONTH IN 2012?!?!
1548198318030745606 2022-07-16 06:50:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd love to spend time time hanging out in the unknown corners of Inner Mongolia...I haven't been there since 2012.  Check this thread out.
1548197692014153734 2022-07-16 06:47:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Pat_Elder Greta thread! Let's start a movement.   How many tourists do you see around? I've had a long-held theory that "if you've seen it on Douyin, it's already too late".
1548192691892015106 2022-07-16 06:27:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 In the end, the top level developer buys up all these project rights, deploys capital, builds the rooftop installations, and signs an offtake agreement with the grid at the base coal rate (and sells some power into the market too, per regulatory mandate).
1548191912221294592 2022-07-16 06:24:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 They're selling what we call "lutiao" Ë∑ØÊù°„ÄÇ Normally we roughly translate it as "project development rights". It's a valuable and labor intensive part of pre-construction. It's building up some equity value and then selling it off before you have to commit capital.
1548191247008796673 2022-07-16 06:22:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 It's like buying a cake where the ingredients are already mixed but you have to bake it yourself.  The rooftops have been selected, the contracts with the owners in place, the construction permits secured...They just haven't started building yet.
1548187220128849923 2022-07-16 06:06:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 As far as rates...the grid pays less, but it's guaranteed. Currently wholesale rates are about 20% higher than the grid base rate. You can opt to take your power to the wholesale market directly but you will need experience to market and sell it effectively and mitigate risk.
1548186338536460290 2022-07-16 06:02:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 There's merchant risk associated with offtake to the wholesale market which large companies are better equipped to assume.  Also the raw CAPEX of developing 300 or 500 MW across an entire county is something large companies will be a better fit for.
1548185694656286735 2022-07-16 06:00:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 The grid gives guaranteed offtake for a certain number of hours annually, but the long term plan is to shift it all over to the wholesale market. To ease into that requirement, they started by requiring 10% offtake to the merchant market and will slowly raise that %.
1548012833392443393 2022-07-15 18:33:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HAPPY889123 Thanks! Glad you enjoy :)
1548011655095009280 2022-07-15 18:28:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My tour of Dehang concludes with some hiking and lovely natural scenery:   https://t.co/1hybfQa7jw
1548010233515380736 2022-07-15 18:22:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So!  That concludes Aizhai/Dehang. It should be more well known for a weekend trip in Hunan!  It's got nice hiking paths, cultural tourism that isn't too sleazy, a river to play in for kids, supports the local economy, isn't hard to get to, and overall gets a thumbs up from me.  https://t.co/mXSyYzqByB
1548010182537793536 2022-07-15 18:22:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This was our last day here and we had a train to catch, so I hoofed it back down the canyon trail and returned to the guesthouse in Dehang.  On the way back I passed one family of three and one young guy hiking solo. Four people, in 3 hours. The tranquility is too precious.
1548010178448343041 2022-07-15 18:22:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think the tourist economy has mostly missed Jidou. People likely want to visit Dehang where all the action and scenery is.  I expect most of the working-age adults in Jidou have jobs outside of the village...like most "normal" Chinese villages really (which don't have tourism).  https://t.co/SRlcSwuLbW
1548009952778022912 2022-07-15 18:21:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You might be able to tell from the pictures that Jidou village is much smaller and more rundown than Dehang. There were signs for a few guesthouses, but I think they were closed. I didn't stay long because there was nothing to do and few people to talk to, mostly elders and kids.  https://t.co/yq27Uh2Qj8
1548009931546443778 2022-07-15 18:21:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I appreciated how they didn't put a safety barrier around the edge of the viewing platform and impact the view.  Instead, the attraction designers opted for this ‚Äúsafety‚Äù fence hidden below the cliff edge. So you won't die, just gently smash your face into those metal poles.  https://t.co/Lt6F9O9ye3
1548009920335081472 2022-07-15 18:21:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Jidou Village is also where you can find the viewing platform in the photo in the first tweet of this thread.   It's called the Â§©ÈóÆÂè∞ "Platform for Asking the Heavens".  SUPPOSEDLY this is where Qu Yuan stood when composing his famous poem „ÄäÂ§©ÈóÆ„Äã so it was given this name...  https://t.co/M2mpB3Y6aU
1548009908515532800 2022-07-15 18:21:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the top of the canyon, you'll reach Jidou Village, population 170, another Miao community within the Aizhai Wonders scenic area. They have a "rural agriculture demonstration zone" with some gently cascading rice terraces, corn, and a few other crops.  https://t.co/rLYC1UVTRH
1548009883420999680 2022-07-15 18:21:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That was the point I realized I had almost gotten to the top of the canyon wall, which is where the highway comes strutting through, preparing to feed into the Aizhai Bridge. I didn't get to walk across the Aizhai Bridge but it's quite feat of engineering:  (pics are Googled)  https://t.co/uRzJ088Ova
1548009874059317248 2022-07-15 18:21:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After hiking for an hour, as I think I've left civilization behind, this truly unexpected sight emerges from between two mountains...an elevated highway?!  https://t.co/kEDNOvamYX
1548009864517283840 2022-07-15 18:21:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Further along, I discover this waterfall, a white curtain bouncing and foaming 40 meters down the canyon wall to the creek bed below, sending a light rainbow spray across the path.  As I have been all morning, I am all alone. Just me and the crickets.  https://t.co/LOyzSq91e0
1548009548665204736 2022-07-15 18:20:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As I get deeper into the canyon, I feel I've left the world behind. All I hear is the chirp of crickets and the gentle gurgle of trickling water.  I cup my hands beneath this rock face and gather a mouthful of cool water. It is sweet and smooth, with no minerality.  https://t.co/0N8po43LtM
1548009532395499520 2022-07-15 18:20:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Dehang Village is in the deepest part of the canyon. The last morning I hiked the trail that cuts through the cliffs all the way to the top of the canyon walls.  It's a brisk 90-minute hike, following the creek up the canyon floor, passing under sheer rock faces and waterfalls...  https://t.co/2tewMVEyS4
1548009519347023872 2022-07-15 18:20:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I don't have any deep cultural learnings to share about Dehang Canyon. It's just really pretty.  It's a crying shame that this place isn't more famous. I'll do my best to help it out, with a thread of mediocre photography 100% hard carried by amazing views. üßµ  https://t.co/RI4cM69BXx

1547842431441567745 2022-07-15 07:16:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Nice OrzOrzOrzOrz of China watchers they have going there
1547810103566663680 2022-07-15 05:07:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc I went through a one-week period after leaving SH where my face felt naked without a mask, but it's fine now. People's attitudes around here are like "oh yeah...covid...i've heard of it..."
1547809730282033152 2022-07-15 05:06:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chris__pc When was the last XJ had an outbreak? I haven't been seeing many masks in a lot of places in central China...I think it would really stick out/look weird if there was a public event around here and everyone was wearing masks. Probably the same case out there?
1547646998014480384 2022-07-14 18:19:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My exploration of Dehang continues with an obligatory discussion of local food:   https://t.co/RA5o3nxc9j
1547646688944603136 2022-07-14 18:18:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's all I've got for tonight.  Next time, we'll admire Dehang Canyon scenery and maybe make it over to Furong Village...we'll see.  Here's the first thread on Dehang Village, if you missed it and want to know who Auntie Shi is:   https://t.co/90vbLGmqYe
1547641865251737600 2022-07-14 17:59:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's always a nice change of pace to come out to the countryside and have a little refresh of your diet for a few days. Maybe country food won't blow you away; you're more there for fresh ingredients and vibes.  And, if you ask the right questions, you can get an education too.
1547641861724327937 2022-07-14 17:59:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She thinks their local pork tastes better because the pigs eat mostly natural stuff like vegetables, table scraps, and farming trimmings. She's heard the pigs raised in the city eat cornmeal, and their fat is the wrong color and their meat isn't as good.  I'm sure she's right.
1547641856393379840 2022-07-14 17:59:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's most common in the village to slaughter your last pig at New Year, then in the spring, go into town and buy piglets to raise for the year.  Auntie Shi doesn't eat much meat, but she's good at choosing healthy piglets. Her husband is bad at it, so she doesn't let him choose.
1547641850089345024 2022-07-14 17:59:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's one other dish that you can make with your fresh pork: Miao sour pork. As far as I can tell, this dish is unique to the Miao, and is MOST famous here in Xiangxi.  Fresh pork is covered in cornmeal, aged/fermented for 15 days, then fried. It has a mild, tingly sourness.  https://t.co/2prdUFizCp
1547641838060052480 2022-07-14 17:59:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Auntie Shi says most Miao families raise 1-3 pigs each year in pens under their stilted homes. When one is slaughtered, you get to eat fresh pork for a week and the rest is turned into the ham we're eating now. So if you get a dish with fresh pork, it's probably from outside.
1547641834763354112 2022-07-14 17:59:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Auntie Shi of course, is a grown-ass adult, so she doesn't take the bait. "Well she needs her ham for her family. Her business is good, so I guess she has to buy from outside for her guests."  "I've never tried it though. I don't like to eat too much meat".  Fair enough.
1547641830875230208 2022-07-14 17:59:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After I enjoyed Auntie Yang's ham, I am now sure that the first restauant gave me store-bought ham. I try to make some gossip by snitching to my buddy Auntie Shi.  "Do you know they're using store-bought ham over there?" I ask. Classic shit-stirrer move, I know.
1547641827540729856 2022-07-14 17:59:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I tell her I would have loved to book her guesthouse, but she has only ONE review on Ctrip. She doesn't get Ctrip; her son set it up.  We spend 20 minutes walking her through the finer points of farming good reviews for hotel booking websites. Least we could do. For the ham.
1547641821891010560 2022-07-14 17:58:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Auntie Yang isn't from Dehang; she moved here when she married. If you're from Dehang, your surname is Shi.  Miao avoid marrying someone with same name, so they have to find spouses in different villages.  Auntie Yang, like Auntie Shi, says I'm paying too much for my guesthouse.  https://t.co/53cJpACD0t
1547641808980942848 2022-07-14 17:58:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By contrast, here's the ham dish we get the next day at a different restaurant in the village. I'm certain this is her own homemade ham. The pieces are jagged, irregular, and taste only of fat, smoke, salt, and botulism. They are goddamn perfection. Thanks Auntie Yang.  https://t.co/W3g83cslRd
1547641796846821376 2022-07-14 17:58:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unwilling to waste, I ate the whole dish, despite its suspiciously uniform slices and off-putting chemical taste.  Later that night I got a ripping headache. Case closed.  I don't blame her for serving commercial product to tourists - I blame me for not avoiding the tourist trap.
1547641790312095744 2022-07-14 17:58:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, at this busy restaurant, I was very disappointed by the meat.  Just one bite and I knew I wasn't eating the homemade product hanging over the wok. With her guest turnover, there's no way she could serve them all from her own supplies. She was serving me commercial ham. üò°  https://t.co/MXVBb3DHjj
1547641775703363584 2022-07-14 17:58:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But on the other hand sodium nitrite has been linked to a heightened risk of colon cancer.  Some people (like me) are sensitive to it and get wicked headaches when we eat a bit too much of the stuff.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I choose mold.   https://t.co/c2y4FT7Pbf
1547641770619858944 2022-07-14 17:58:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now fair warning here: Miao aunties are NOT adding a pinch of nitrites to their homemade cured ham, the way commercial cured meats are made. It's just salt and spices.  Nitrites kill nasty bacteria like the one that causes botulism.  They also help stop the growth of mold.  https://t.co/PDRKHpo83S
1547641759051952129 2022-07-14 17:58:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the picture above, the ducks, sausages, &amp; hams are curing directly over the wok, so every time she cooks, she adds a layer of wok smoke to the hanging meat.  The oldest, funkiest ones get fully black with a white mold. At a different restaurant, we saw cured pig heads too.  https://t.co/Azc2uWXszV
1547641744183164928 2022-07-14 17:58:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There is ONE thing, however, that I always seek out when I go to the Chinese countryside. There's ONE thing that they make much better here than anything you can buy in the grocery stores in the city.  That one thing is Chinese countryside cured meat (ËÖäËÇâ).  https://t.co/qDH0lIwiJ1
1547641718451109888 2022-07-14 17:58:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's the restaurant pre-frying river fish for use later in the day. I don't like foods that have been pre-fried and then re-fried, so I avoid ordering them. I would love to eat these freshly-made though.  The seasoning is simple: salt, pepper, chilis, soy sauce, MSG  https://t.co/gBiPyt7V2M
1547641648339099648 2022-07-14 17:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's not BAD of course. But by Chn standards? Compared to a trained chef, with access to full range of ingredients, styles, &amp; preparations from thousands of years of accumulated culinary wisdom? No shot.  At its best, it's simple food with fresh ingredients and rural vibes.  https://t.co/vQK6ONvqcd
1547641621155827712 2022-07-14 17:58:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But first let me say something might earn me some flak.  In general, I do not think rural Chinese countryside food is very good. There, I said it.  It's usually over- or under-seasoned, ingredients are limited, the execution is sloppy, and there's way too much fried stuff.
1547641611357929472 2022-07-14 17:58:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The video above was taken at an open-air kitchen and restaurant near the exit to the performance hall in Dehang Village.

1547641592546496513 2022-07-14 17:58:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What do you eat in a Miao village? How does it compare to Chinese city cooking?  I know one thing for sure...if it's not cooked in a giant wok over a wood fire, it just won't taste the same. üòâ  Time for another üßµ of Hunan food porn and culture:  https://t.co/eJv76IYWkj
1547631177171091456 2022-07-14 17:16:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @adambrowning @KyleCherrick No, the PPA will need to be renewed after the first 5-year period. Renewal is a handshake formality though.  In 2030 (or sooner, if they want) they'll have to switch over to offtaking into the open markets instead though (where, for the moment anyway, rates are ~20% higher).
1547506245720244225 2022-07-14 09:00:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Abhinavgoyal82 Righht - these assets aren't used by the rooftop owners. It's a solar plant spread across many rooftops, selling to the grid.  If the rooftop owner elects to own the panels, they will resell the power to the project developer/consolidator.  Otherwise they earn rent + dividends.
1547462958963621893 2022-07-14 06:08:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KyleCherrick @adambrowning Right now you can get a grid-parity PPA benchmarked to coal base price (which is fixed) for 5 years. Extension is usually a formatlity.  Merchant rate is higher right now, but ofc means taking on merchant risk.  China is pushing all generators to 100% merchant offtake by 2030 tho
1547462020781715457 2022-07-14 06:04:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KyleCherrick So it looks like the outs would be made available via the ladder structures, e.g., one had 5 years + 5 years + 15 years. Not sure the exact logic that went into designing these lease options, but i'm sure it was designed to address some rooftop-owner concerns.
1547461573295624194 2022-07-14 06:02:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KyleCherrick I'm sure it will always vary across counties, but a found a guidance document in Shandong that described two different leasing models, with a mix of rents + dividends along with different duration ladder/tier structures, but in the end both had options for up to 25 years.
1547459017710407680 2022-07-14 05:52:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KyleCherrick @adambrowning China has grid-parity for newbuild RE so you could call it "FiT" but really it's just benchmarked to the provincial coal-fired power base price (paid by the grid).  Unless it's selling into the wholesale market instead, in which case it gets whatever the merchant rate is.
1547374720152379393 2022-07-14 00:17:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @19Joe92 I described the two financing models here:  The top developer has two offtake channels: the grid company or the wholesale power market. Depending on provincial policy, they will be obligated to sell a certain volume via open market and grid buys the rest.   https://t.co/tuXkJxGXPo
1547373247854886912 2022-07-14 00:11:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FeiShengchao I expect considerable upgrades to the distribution grid would be required...but I'm sure the solar resources are good.

1547271042804371456 2022-07-13 17:25:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @brucemangy You need to find a place to install the solar panels before you can start using them üòâ  Many people don't like using land for solar that could be used for farming or other purposes. The rooftops of already-existing buildings is a solution that generally upsets few people.
1547269614622900224 2022-07-13 17:19:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @brucemangy You don't want solar panels unless they are solar panels made with solar power?  I have bad news for you...  https://t.co/OYMNMmV4gQ
1547268571436560384 2022-07-13 17:15:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HeyBirt The coal plants are built as firm capacity to support  renewables. Chinese coal-fired consumption is *down* YoY and has been falling as a percentage of overall energy usage for quite a few years. As an industry, we're planning for coal newbuild to be ended entirely in 2025.

1547238582632747008 2022-07-13 15:16:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mollythecat19 @FrancoisOuell15 But yes, what you are describing is necessary for self-consumption of your own rooftop solar. This is a slightly different model.
1547238318269943808 2022-07-13 15:15:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mollythecat19 @FrancoisOuell15 The solar installs described in this program are not driven by end-user desire to have rooftop solar to consume.  The big solar company using the rooftop space as a place to put solar panels and have a large-scale solar farm linking together many different distributed rooftops.
1547214163210289157 2022-07-13 13:39:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ravinaproject *and still coal of course
1547213257483898880 2022-07-13 13:36:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ravinaproject Indeed!  The answer varies province and in the short term involves coal in most places (spinning reserve during the day).  Over the longer term as the curve gets steeper...mmm. Nukes + pumped hydro + batteries seems to be the plan.
1547211795257262081 2022-07-13 13:30:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joebeattie @PekingMike You linked to it in the first place. Either you think it's a good source worth paying attention to, or you think it's a bad source that's not worth paying attention to. You can't have it both ways my dude.

1547181738564419584 2022-07-13 11:30:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @liuxinzheng Do you have some source or data to back up "at least half"? That's a pretty aggressive claim.
1547181362406637568 2022-07-13 11:29:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gkrnours @maaniblr @JVos63 Chinese policy on recycling/disposal is still immature. The intention is to extract the useful materials and dispose of the rest, but the policy framework isn't there yet. The very oldest panels will not hit the end of their lifespan until about 2030 so they have a few years.
1547180901154824194 2022-07-13 11:27:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mollythecat19 @FrancoisOuell15 These projects should be under a 100% sell-to-grid model in most cases.  The model where you use what you need and sell the excess to the grid is called net metering and is not yet available in most places in China.
1547179471153041409 2022-07-13 11:21:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lostin_hk Considering the scale of the solar (an intermittent generator) being installed, the last coal power built before the cutoff in 2025 is necessary to provide firm backup supply.  Actually it's quite the puzzle to me how they'll be able to keep building solar like this after 2025.
1547154178442948608 2022-07-13 09:41:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ka1mar With rare exceptions, I would expect these panels to offtake 100% to the grid (i.e. no self-consumption).
1547138748785524736 2022-07-13 08:39:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I should clarify - 600GW of potential once the policy is extended to all eligible counties, not just the ones in the pilot.
1547138151831187456 2022-07-13 08:37:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @AshinChina hah of course you have one already.  I should have checked...
1547135953982324737 2022-07-13 08:28:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina I mean you'll probably never get your money back...but it could be a fun investment and good to teach kids about power generation at home.  @RealSexyCyborg you wanna test one of these things and do a teardown?
1547135564805451776 2022-07-13 08:27:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina Sadly I don't think it's in the cards. But you can get some neat balcony solar gensets on Taobao if you have a good balcony facing the right direction.  They have adapters and battery versions, so you can charge your phone and plug in a hair dryer, stuff like that...üôÉ
1547135038760034304 2022-07-13 08:25:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BogaerTim For the first part of your question...it will be known once all the individual counties finish their installations.  Here's one county that says their project will be about 300MW.  But I wouldn't dare to calc 300MW * 660 counties without more data.   https://t.co/if8skUX1YA
1547134670672101376 2022-07-13 08:23:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BogaerTim If you want to delete and repost, I won't tell anyone ;)  The second part of the question is really hard to answer haha...it's different pieces of different provinces at a county level. Certainly would cover the entire population of many European countries though, I guess.
1547131513351057408 2022-07-13 08:11:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BogaerTim Thanks for the RT!  Please note that 600GW is the *total* potential, if this program is extended to all eligible counties in China.   Currently this is just the pilot phase, with 600+ counties. Which is a lot of course, but still only a fraction of the whole country.
1547129817547800576 2022-07-13 08:04:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina You meet for off-grid living, or just as a guy who owns an apartment in China and wants to have rooftop solar?  The latter in China is probably impossible unless you get the homeowner's association to somehow agree on everything...
1547127041488994304 2022-07-13 07:53:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LumijarviAleksi This is how China implements a lot of policies really. When your population is that large and that spread out, you have to set targets at the national level, strategies at the provincial level, &amp; tactics at the local level (and hope you've incentivized everyone accordingly).
1547122581689745408 2022-07-13 07:35:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nasirumb @TheREANigeria Great to hear! Hopefully China will soon have some best practices and implementation experience to offer as a reference. We'll see after the end of this first pilot in 2023.
1547119729344905216 2022-07-13 07:24:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sxpert1 Maybe the 30% was chosen based on some evaluation of how many rooftops are suitable for solar, on average.  For another example, 20% for residential seems low, but Bloomberg estimates only 35% of Chn residential rooftops are suitable for solar overall, so 20% is actually a lot.
1547119063796961280 2022-07-13 07:21:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SVKJK93 Legacy projects are still on FiT rates with subsidies.  Newbuild distributed solar is either on a grid-parity PPA with the local grid company (i.e. local coal benchmark) or sells into the wholesale market at merchant rates. The latter will be required after 2030.
1547115119414767616 2022-07-13 07:06:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sxpert1 Warehouses most likely would fall into the category of "industrial and commercial buildings" so at least 30% of all such facilities in the county would have to get 'paneled up' to meet the mandate.
1547114466785239040 2022-07-13 07:03:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wizardofid Behind-the-meter storage is too expensive in most places in China still. Storage is mostly used on the generation side or grid side for generation smoothing, frequency regulation, etc.
1547113532378202112 2022-07-13 06:59:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DatabaseSponge Chinese PV sector is still quite quiet policy-wise on how to approach recycling and disposal. It's not a huge problem yet, but it will be pretty soon. In the meantime, the only org. I know that's actively working on standards is this industry alliance:   https://t.co/H9ybdYNRMv
1547111048356175872 2022-07-13 06:49:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Investing in storage to defer grid investments is a valid usage case, but only to a certain extent. At some point you're just slapping extra plasters on a injury that just needs surgery.  And yeah...the economics suck for end-users most of the time.
1547110304618024961 2022-07-13 06:46:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Yep...if it can happen even in a country as centrally-planned as China, it stands to reason that it would be even harder to predict install capacity when you've left the development and investment decisions up to individual homeowners.
1547105895720820737 2022-07-13 06:29:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Aizazadi_ This chart is just # of counties.  I did a separate calc in my excel sheet to calculate % of counties covered in a specific province. If that was that the question?
1547096617324781568 2022-07-13 05:52:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, I think this model is one to take notice of, both for what it means for solar development in China, but also for applicability in other countries.  I'd like to hear from people with experience in other markets how/why this would/wouldn't work where you are.
1547096614430720000 2022-07-13 05:52:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think it's a great example of how to merge public &amp; private resources to implement top-down policy.  A national policy + a rich developer (often SOE) + an army of local-level hustlers, public AND private, a machine that will cover millions of rooftops with solar in just 2 yrs.
1547096608827113473 2022-07-13 05:52:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Another issue is the sheer volume of the solar power coming online could create issues for the local grid infrastructure.  We've seen cases of local grid companies demanding a halt/slowdown of these buildouts for this reason, citing insufficient offtake capability/congestion.
1547096605882728453 2022-07-13 05:52:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> More care needs to be taken to protect rural residents from bad solar panel debt, &amp; more avenues made available to punish those who take advantage unfairly.  Other types of rooftop owners like industrial parks or hospitals are likely to be savvy enough to stay out of bad deals.
1547096601063489537 2022-07-13 05:52:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There are challenges of course. For instance, unsophisticated rural residents could be pressured to take on bad loans by unscrupulous local developers. We've seen this before for poverty-alleviation projecs too - it's nearly inevitable when you decentralize execution this much.
1547096598186201093 2022-07-13 05:52:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's common for this to be farmed out to smaller "village-level" or "town-level" developers, who take the work of identifying the rooftops, secure project development rights, &amp; package it up and 'sell' their piece of the project up the chain to the Big Developer (often an SOE).
1547096595392794624 2022-07-13 05:52:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Obviously the work involved to organize these projects is massive. The developer must submit a consolidated tender to develop the whole county.  This involves an extensive canvassing effort together with local gov't to identify residents willing to host solar panels.
1547096592582586369 2022-07-13 05:52:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Two reasons:   1. The residents can apply for a VAT exemption for installing rooftop solar.  2. The rural residents tend to take better care of the solar panels when they own them.  There have been problems with rural residents using the panels to hang clothes or dry grain...lol
1547096589654966272 2022-07-13 05:52:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Whole County projects may adopt one of two models:   1. The owners of the rooftops finance the panels themselves and sell the power to the developer;   2. The developer leases the rooftop space from the owners and owns the panels themselves.  The first model is preferred. Why?
1547096584328183808 2022-07-13 05:52:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shortly thereafter, the first batch of 676 pilot counties  selected for Whole County Rooftop Solar were announced (there was an application and vetting process).  In places like Shandong or Henan, more than 75% of the counties in the whole province were selected.  https://t.co/MO1UBlGOqM
1547096570260508672 2022-07-13 05:52:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back in 2021 when the pilot policy was announced, Chinese analysts estimated that implementation of this policy alone represented 600GW (!!) of distributed solar capacity market potential - even with the relatively low coverage targets for residential (just 20%).  https://t.co/EsreuH8Ttm
1547096553621712896 2022-07-13 05:52:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's worth pointing out that "County" usually means any administrative district at the county  level, not necessarily just counties Âéø, per se.  So that would include county-level cities ÂéøÁ∫ßÂ∏Ç and even city districts Âå∫. See, for example, the 19 pilot sites in Hubei:  https://t.co/a1voq8GuFG
1547096535070310400 2022-07-13 05:52:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This has been covered in industry media, by the way, but not mainstream, but I wish it would.  Basically, a county is partnered with a large developer in the PV sector to cover XX% of the rooftops in that county with solar PV by a certain date. See:   https://t.co/04U4eqWCGq  https://t.co/AwFDUZaBnP
1547096523691151362 2022-07-13 05:52:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An interesting Chinese solar PV policy program that hasn't gotten the airtime it deserves: Whole-County Rooftop Solar Êï¥ÂéøÂ±ãÈ°∂ÂÖâ‰ºè.  I think this policy, more than anything else, has led to China's record-setting figures in 2022 for distributed solar.  What is it? Thread!üßµ  https://t.co/oFPZAjQnBF

1547053432221372416 2022-07-13 03:00:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Basically this means grid operators are preparing for it to get worse, but *we aren't at that point yet.* (at least not publically)  The heat is very real and very dangerous though!

The only way residential loses power is if there's infrastructure damage somewhere, if a bunch of generating assets are brought offline, or if someone monumentally messes up power dispatching.

1546781355463548928 2022-07-12 08:59:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you've been here over this time period, the change in air quality is so obvious. It's nice to put statistics and strategies behind something we've all felt anecdotally.  Of course there are still days of bad air, but much less frequent &amp; much less severe than 10 yrs ago.

1546164261655052288 2022-07-10 16:07:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @loupio66 You can filter for hotels that will definitely accept foreign guests on ctrip. Or you can use the English version  https://t.co/99NyTYyWTH, which filters out hotels that don't accept foreigners automatically. In either case, it's safest to call ahead and confirm anyway.
1546163707235160064 2022-07-10 16:05:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoyuvax Nice details. Very interesting...I wonder whether the development of these towns doesn't also start to present a "third way" lifestyle, where consumption isn't just a binary of A: In the city or B: Far away, on vacation.  Instead, there is a suburban destination for activities.
1546160746031378441 2022-07-10 15:53:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg ah. Noted.

1546054899926183937 2022-07-10 08:53:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent Yeah haha, but they were a different community in Guizhou   https://t.co/fLdntpDVIs
1546054081193869313 2022-07-10 08:49:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm *NOT* demanding. Shit that's a bad typo lol
1546051945269698560 2022-07-10 08:41:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's it for my intro to Dehang!  Next thread, I'll talk about local food, some cultural observations, &amp; the amazing hiking in Dehang Canyon to a different nearby village.  After that, it's off to the famous Furong Town and a sad example IMO of *NON-equitable* rural development.
1546051942648287232 2022-07-10 08:41:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Based on my views on equitable rural development, I couldn't find anything in Dehang that made me uncomfortable to be a consumer there.  Miao locals, including Auntie Shi, just want to live better lives. They want me to eat and drink and spend money. Which I was glad to do.
1546051940391751680 2022-07-10 08:41:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's easy and popular to lean on Western sociological or anthropological tropes like 'cultural appropriation' when trying to understand's China's relations with its ethnic minorities.  I find such (usually well-intentioned!) efforts to be insufficiently nuanced.
1546051935702515712 2022-07-10 08:41:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because in that time, they relied on back-breaking agrarian labor and had their growth stunted by malnutrition.  I saw so many hunchbacked elders around the village I thought they had a genetic issue until Auntie Shi told me it was from carying heavy baskets their whole life!  https://t.co/2bHSL3pdYp
1546051920590442496 2022-07-10 08:41:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Would be neat to see these places Exactly As They Were 50 years ago, when their clothes and songs and dances and way of life were perfectly untainted by modern China and Han tourism?  Yeah sure. But also I don't hope for them to return to that.
1546051918321303552 2022-07-10 08:41:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And I'm demanding you think a certain way about any of this, dear reader.  I'm a guest in this country. A privileged one. A white male from a wealthy nation. All of that has undoubtedly shaped my perspectives in ways I'm not even aware of. But this is how I process it today.
1546051916308021250 2022-07-10 08:41:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nor have I the right to convince Auntie Shi to be upset about something that she isn't.   She's not concerned about Han people LARPing around the village in Miao wedding dresses.  She's concerned about selling enough ice cream and rice noodles to send her kids to school.
1546051913841770497 2022-07-10 08:41:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But in cases like Dehang, or Longji rice terraces last year, the economic trade-offs are obvious and apparent.  I don't think I have the right to expect or demand they reject clear improvements to their quality of life in the name of anthropological or cultural purity.
1546051910922555398 2022-07-10 08:41:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I do have a standard for this. For instance I really disliked my visit to the Ethnic Minorities Village in Kunming. It felt like a zoo.  In that case, I couldn't see the benefit for the minority communities, it was pure cultural consumption with very mild trade-off benefits.
1546051908288524288 2022-07-10 08:41:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And since I don't know it, I have tempered my past inclinations to be critical of this style of cultural tourism.  I think stereotyped messaging about singing, dancing ethnic minorities is not great, but if it helps make this kind of rural development tourism work, I get it.
1546050603516051458 2022-07-10 08:36:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Does it HAVE to be like that? I dunno.  Maybe there's a more optimized, more ideal way to develop these communities so they eat well, buy washing machines, don't have to leave the village &amp; send kids to school WITHOUT losing an ounce of authenticity.  I don't know it though.  https://t.co/D3SoK2zN4K
1546050590463393793 2022-07-10 08:35:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But that's not what I found in Dehang.  Auntie Shi was completely pragmatic on the trade-off (not that she framed it in as such) between economic development &amp; the dilution/distortion of Miao cultural heritage. I gave her plenty of opportunity to say something...she didn't.
1546050587422507008 2022-07-10 08:35:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's a common criticism of China's attitudes towards ethnic minorities, that they are often reduced to stereotypes of "rich traditional culture" &amp; "good at singing &amp; dancing" ËÉΩÊ≠åÂñÑËàû.  And the assumption, by extension, that they are upset about it. Or at least they should be.
1546050581370138624 2022-07-10 08:35:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And I must say, at least in this village, it appears to be done on terms acceptable to the locals.  A generation ago, they were sustenance famers ekeing out a meagre existence in a picturesque but very damp canyon. Now they eat well, buy cars and send their kids out to school.  https://t.co/btFhUd6w3W
1546050568124518401 2022-07-10 08:35:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, the village looks to me like a moderate success case for cultural tourism poverty alleviation, covid notwithstanding.  Hunan leaders appear motivated to chuck money at Xiangxi until the relevant poverty-busting KPIs are met. It shows.  Quote from Hunan gov't website:  https://t.co/JqwI9cXnBm
1546050557051543552 2022-07-10 08:35:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So the village economy is good? Does the tourism development company pay dividends to the villagers? ‚ÄúYes, but if they don't make money, we don't get money. Since covid, there are less tourists.‚Äù  Seems common for poverty alleviation tourism:  https://t.co/AkJLHtAA41
1546050551770923010 2022-07-10 08:35:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It seems most of the guesthouses in the village can be had for under 100 per night. Crap. Most of the local guesthouses aren't on Ctrip.  I ask whose cars are in the parking lot next to my guesthouse.  "Only villagers...outside cars aren't allowed to drive in".  Hm. Not bad:  https://t.co/CVQHOGnTeb
1546050528177967104 2022-07-10 08:35:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My guesthouse is at the entrance to the village, next to the village Party service center and the parking lot. It's not fancy, but it is pretty new. She asks how much I'm paying per night.  "200?" She makes a grimace and sucks in air.  Is that too expensive? (Oh yeah it is).
1546050520791785472 2022-07-10 08:35:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What about the tourists that rent local clothing and take pics? Does that bother her?   She didn't get it. "What's wrong with that?"  Because they aren't Miao. Should they wear Miao clothes? "If they like it, then why not?"  Do others mind? "I don't know. I don't think so."  https://t.co/POLjxptE5O
1546050499765768192 2022-07-10 08:35:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I asked: What do you think about tourists coming here to watch Miao performances with these clothes?  "I don't care, as long as they enjoy it. They will come to the village and spend money".  To buy your ice cream?  Laughs. "Right. To buy my ice cream"
1546050493759504385 2022-07-10 08:35:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I asked: Do Miao people ever wear those clothes? Or are they only to show tourists?  She thinks for a second. "Maybe for a wedding in the old days. But definitely not for daily life. It would get dirty. And we are in a canyon...you can't wear a dress here. Too many mosquitoes".  https://t.co/mxTXrumGsv
1546050470573391872 2022-07-10 08:35:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She's been open so far, so I ask more pointed questions.  What are the costumes? Are those real Miao clothes?   She laughs, gesturing to her own clothing (pants with an embroidered design near the ankle).  "We wear this. You can't wear a dress here...not practical"  Pic: Taobao  https://t.co/KTJ2BUnNRV
1546050464919490561 2022-07-10 08:35:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First I asked her where the performers come from. Are they local? Yes. Some are from here, or other Miao villages nearby.  How are the wages? 3-4k per month, the same as you could make doing other tourism jobs.  Does she like to sing &amp; dance? Nah, doesn't care much for either.
1546050462088298497 2022-07-10 08:35:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Her name is Shi. She has heavily-tanned, weathered face covered in lines when she smiles, which is often. She could be 35 years old...or 50.  Auntie Shi became my primary source for Miao culture fact-checking, village history, and general local gossip for the next 3 days.
1546050458988716032 2022-07-10 08:35:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I left the performance hall halfway through the show and went looking for locals. Outside near the performance hall, I find a local woman managing her breakfast stall and shop.  It's already 34 degrees, so I buy an ice cream and linger while eating, asking questions.  Pic: Baidu  https://t.co/e9BaQ2Cge0
1546050450449125376 2022-07-10 08:35:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back to Dehang. On my first day, I checked out the performances.  "Traditional Miao courtship dance" "Traditional Miao folk song" "Traditional Dehang drum performance"  The performances are fine and audience was into it, but the performers look bored, as was I.
1546050444593876992 2022-07-10 08:35:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, Hunan has been spending huge Ôø•Ôø• on developing Xiangxi tourism, building scenic areas, connecting villages, and connecting its first high-speed rail line from Zhangjiajie to Huaihua in Dec. 2021.  I took it twice and it was packed both times.  https://t.co/gbJEY6WWAy  https://t.co/z5D7HrN8GP
1546050435337039872 2022-07-10 08:35:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is obviously covid tourism downturn. Online sources say Aizhai used to get 300k tourists a year.   The infrastructure investments, exhibition area, performance hall, all made sense before.   There's even a new fire truck, which I forgot to film (this is from Baidu):  https://t.co/etTE2qrSmZ
1546050416353636352 2022-07-10 08:35:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Before talking to anyone, I can tell the province hasn't gotten its investment back on the 5A upgrade so far.  Half the guesthouses have locks on the doors. The performance hall is only a quarter full (at best) during shows. Most areas of the cultural exhibitions are closed.  https://t.co/hbPyTCUGhX
1546050402264952832 2022-07-10 08:35:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the entrance to the village is a Miao culture "poverty alleviation demo area." It has tea drying, rice-cake making, extraction of tea oil, basket-weaving, etc.  Further in is a performance hall, which has twice-daily performances of dancing &amp; singing (we'll get back to this).  https://t.co/d2qgITULUt
1546050375538855936 2022-07-10 08:35:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Dehang is a Miao ethnicity village (more well-known as Hmong outside of China).  Ethnic minorities make up &gt;70% of the pop. in Xiangxi (and 100% of this village).  Dehang means nothing in Mandarin; it's a transliteration of Miao words:  de:  beautiful hang: canyon  https://t.co/8haVICfMYM
1546050361408233472 2022-07-10 08:35:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Compared to other Chinese tourist villages I've visited in the past, Dehang village (population ~500) is underdeveloped, probably because the 5A rating is so new.  The infrastructure is mostly geared towards day travelers, not people staying overnight. Few guesthouses.  https://t.co/AVXjXfs4mS
1546050328029970432 2022-07-10 08:34:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think most tourists do it as a day trip package tour, but I was in no rush, so I booked 3 nights in a guesthouse in Dehang Âæ∑Â§Ø village.  Aizhai markets itself as a site for both natural (scenic) &amp; cultural (ethnic) tourism and I felt I'd get more of both actually staying here.  https://t.co/GkDsTJYcqm
1546050314251694082 2022-07-10 08:34:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Aizhai ÁüÆÂØ® is a new (June '21) 5A attraction west of Jishou city. Within the scenic area are several Miao ethnic villages, Dehang Canyon, &amp; Aizhai Bridge.  The entire area is out-of-this-world beautiful, esp. when the mist rolls in. It's the kind of place to make you spiritual.  https://t.co/KXXKagPdh9
1546050297910685696 2022-07-10 08:34:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ethnic tourism in China - doing it well involves carefully walking a thin line, but I believe it's possible.

1545300489440739329 2022-07-08 06:55:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CaiYineng I suspect HK/TW. They appear to encourage "actually it's ok to hate the Chinese people too, not just the CCP" in a way that you rarely see from western China watchers.

1544599938033942529 2022-07-06 08:31:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ShiYueme Yeah definitely - these look like toys compared to some of the lifts performed for the AP1000.  Modularized construction of modular reactors...heh
1544579267023237120 2022-07-06 07:09:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Yeah I thought I'd be like this  https://t.co/qUukw8OQ30
1544568645476843520 2022-07-06 06:27:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Addendum: Seems this project hasn't been THAT low-key; I just haven't been paying close enough attention. üòÖ   https://t.co/ldjSn0Fx67
1544568409178140673 2022-07-06 06:26:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kindofanalyst Ah...I must admit I haven't followed it that closely this year - guess I missed a few updates üò≥  CGN's floating NPP I know even less about tbh. I was involved in some talks between a US firm and the CHN design institute back in 2014-16 but has been off my radar since then.
1544540795235368960 2022-07-06 04:36:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unlike the conventional reactor program, I can't claim much insight into the development of CN's SMR projects, except that all the majors have one.  The Chinese online commentariat seems sure this project is related to nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development tho.
1544540792584572928 2022-07-06 04:36:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The reactor design is the Linglong One Áé≤Èæô‰∏ÄÂè∑, a reference to the Hualong One.  The name is probably(?) a nod to the idiom Â∞èÂ∑ßÁé≤Áèë which means small and dainty, or delicate.   So if Hualong One is the "Chinese Dragon" then the Linglong One is the "Delicate Dragon"...cute.
1544540788285390849 2022-07-06 04:36:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I grabbed the header pic from this Hainan news page which also has a nice vid of the SMR's containment shell lift, completed a few days ago.  Should be some interesting stuff if you were having trouble envisioning what modularized construction looks like.   https://t.co/KKmh80p6hB  https://t.co/FxwmDMMIZM
1544540689790566400 2022-07-06 04:36:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Chinese nuclear project update -  A project that's kept a VERY low profile since its FCD last year: the 125MW CNNC-led Small Modular Reactor (SMR) down in Hainan.  Announcement came yesterday that the first "pre-installation" equipment was put into place.   https://t.co/W1P7d6Kozv  https://t.co/2XpWD1d6Ck

1544330315908333570 2022-07-05 14:40:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @abcampbell Yep!
1544329454586998786 2022-07-05 14:36:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RutiliaAugusta I thought of sim city too but I'm actually still playing cities:skylines right now so I had to choose it as the reference
1544255227221901312 2022-07-05 09:41:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @vic_tangerine Yeah I was told the area up to the north around the universities/train station looks like..normal city stuff.  A shame that I was only transiting through for a day and a half, and didn't get to explore more. Amazed to find someone on Twitter who even lived there for a few weeks.
1544206269632094209 2022-07-05 06:27:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 I agree
1544202483706494978 2022-07-05 06:12:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dravirmani Thanks for the QRT! But my thread doesn't summarize that.  My prediction, if you read the whole thread to its conclusion, is that the city will gradually fill up to meet the urbanization needs of the region, following a similar path to other planned cities in China.
1544201545486864386 2022-07-05 06:08:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda @JChengWSJ Yes...a particularly extreme example haha

1544197228222627840 2022-07-05 05:51:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt lol! not a problem for you then.
1544196213146537984 2022-07-05 05:47:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay I'l try that in the next one
1544193902311522304 2022-07-05 05:38:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay Obviously I don't want to be egging on disputes, but also reality is almost always messy too.  I'm gonna get into some sticky topics on the next thread about ethnic minority tourism though...there's no way around talking about it without having some kind of opinion.
1544193259563806720 2022-07-05 05:35:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay It's tricky for me. I have an opinion, of course, but also think the world has heard SO much of the opinions of first-world white men on China.  Erring towards aloof, factual traveloguing is a comfortable first step for me, while I figure out how/if to work my views into it.
1544190915501498369 2022-07-05 05:26:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JudeWhatever Yes, I expect the growth of Jishou would be from other parts of the Ëá™Ê≤ªÂ∑û
1544190675574726656 2022-07-05 05:25:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jamesxv_t Yeah I thought so too. Maybe it was inflated for advertising purposes? And yes it's 5th tier.
1544189615720247297 2022-07-05 05:21:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Urthor Yep. Especially for more rural parts of the province, originally these people would likely have had to urbanize by moving to far-away Changsha.  Now they'll have the option to urbanize to a city closer to home, far more affordable and still within the autonomous prefecture.
1544187898068860928 2022-07-05 05:14:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> damn this thread is like a Room of Requirement; no matter where they stand, everyone appears to be seeing proof of what they believed already.üôÉ
1544187032645570560 2022-07-05 05:10:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DerNiederbayer Let's call Pudong the fully-materialized vision of success, Ordos maybe halfway there, (after spending a few years in a much less-promising state, capturing the attention of China bears) and a place like Jishou about 10-25% along the journey.
1544176480070307840 2022-07-05 04:28:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JDMayger Next thread will be scenic scenery and the always-controversial/juicy topic of ethnic minority tourism in China. It'll be a doozy.  (Keep writing good stuff and I'm happy to keep tweeting it üòâ )
1544174888289988611 2022-07-05 04:22:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But then again, this is social media, where people barely read six words before making up their mind,  &amp; where years-old footage is recycled ad nauseum on Youtube.  Many people won't even read to the bottom of this thread. But if you do, thanks! Here's a preview of what's next:üòÑ  https://t.co/BUAR9bDkRf
1544174876675960833 2022-07-05 04:22:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unfortunately I think this distinction is often missed by China's fans and detractors both, or in media.  It's possible for Chn to have both big-brain, future-planned, mixed-used optimized urban developments AND wasteful vanity/GDP bloat projects. It's a big country, after all.
1544174872058011649 2022-07-05 04:22:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think it's really quite different from the other kind of "ghost city" in China, vast plots of cheaply-made McMansions or high-rises on the distant peripheries of cities like Chenzhou.  if you try that in Cities:Skylines, no one will move in either...  https://t.co/TkFDVn6DRj
1544174866777411586 2022-07-05 04:22:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Where will Jishou be in 5-10 years? Well, with jobs created there, its role as the capital, and affordable real estate, I wouldn't be surprised if its population doubles or more, filling up the city over time just like the other "ghost cities", as has been noted.  From wikipedia:  https://t.co/CSXtg5nvcb
1544174857105326080 2022-07-05 04:22:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And that's just it - these urban developments are created with the same logic of an omnipotent city sim video gamer: If you build it, they will come.  They look empty at the start, because they are, until they aren't. Just like Pudong...or Ordos.   https://t.co/sVwTt14KKM
1544174840361660416 2022-07-05 04:22:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Cities need tourist attractions, so there's one of those too, called Qianzhou Ancient City. Built on top of a real old village, most of the construction here is new.  I take a stroll through. Almost everything is closed. It feels like I sneaked into Disney a week before opening.  https://t.co/OYVC7IDbkN
1544174822808514561 2022-07-05 04:22:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few streets away from this empty central plaza area, I find normal life! Traffic, shops, pedestrians.  This is different from those eerie empty housing estates on the edges of cities.  Jishou is a real TOWN that had the infrastructure for a major CITY copy-pasted on top.  https://t.co/F5sqas54S2
1544174516456554496 2022-07-05 04:21:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A new mall is opening here soon, promising to bring Starbucks, Nike, Xiaomi and many other brands, and JOBS.  Outside, they are helpfully advertising the hiring salaries of every store in the mall.  Most retail &amp; F&amp;B jobs hiring at 3-6k per month. High for the region I think.  https://t.co/G1VhbZkKZl
1544174504586641408 2022-07-05 04:21:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A taxi driver told me all the bureaucrats working in the new city gov't here have to commute to work from the residential district to the north.  But until these under-construction malls &amp; office buildings are completed &amp; jobs appear, the area will probably be underpopulated.  https://t.co/DdoN8hJzUo
1544174491735302144 2022-07-05 04:21:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After talking to locals, I discovered:  1. Land is very cheap here, so everything is bigger. See new apartments advertised at 3668 RMB/sqm.  2. This is Jishou new district, with the city govt and planned plazas, hotels, malls, but currently too far from the residential district.  https://t.co/dMlfAyNjsP
1544174479676280833 2022-07-05 04:20:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This video I took standing in the middle of Century Plaza panning 360 degrees really highlights how few people are here (and how nice &amp; clean the place is).  I came twice to make sure, during the day and evening, finding it nearly deserted both times.   What gives?  https://t.co/hrjwYimxXT
1544174411540213761 2022-07-05 04:20:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's the thing: Jishou has not been designed to be a city with 400k people. It feels like a city that has been designed for 5+ million people.  It's about the size of Zixing, but has infrastructure that wouldn't look weird in a provincial capital.  And still building more!  https://t.co/Pg4wvszgwQ
1544174386328268800 2022-07-05 04:20:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This means Jishou doesn't really match up with a prefecture-level  Âú∞Á∫ßÂ∏Ç OR a county-level city ÂéøÁ∫ßÂ∏Ç. It's its own thing, a "Region capital" Â∑ûÈ¶ñÂ∫ú.  Jishou's official population is just over 400k people, which is roughly comparable to a county-level city (Zixing was 320k).  https://t.co/qDUzMGVX1y
1544174371652403200 2022-07-05 04:20:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Background: Jishou is different from other cities I've visited so far. Jishou is the capital of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.  Autonomous prefectures are on the same level as prefecture-level cities.  Xiangxi ÊπòË•ø means "West Hunan" and that's where it is:  https://t.co/oRbw26eQjc
1544174360512331776 2022-07-05 04:20:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What makes a Chinese city qualify as a "ghost city?" A thread.üßµ  After leaving Chenzhou, we made our way to Jishou ÂêâÈ¶ñ, in west Hunan.  Jishou is a good jumping-off point for travel to Fenghuang Ancient City, Dehang Canyon, Furong Village, etc.  Jishou itself is...very empty.  https://t.co/OEdQe6iSDa
1544119489247473664 2022-07-05 00:42:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @andymok I mean it *might* be competent political theater as I assume you could do a survey and reveal a majority of Americans believe gas prices are mostly determined by the gas station owner.

1543754794174623744 2022-07-04 00:33:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 It's more odd that you feel bound to convince me that I'm a victim.  Foreigners in China are incredibly privileged. Either you've not experienced it...Or you have and you were one of those insufferable expats who complained endlessly anyway. I'm kinda feeling the latter.
1543582710630739969 2022-07-03 13:09:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Aizazadi_ Cab drivers are hit or miss. Sometimes you get one who just wants to talk about American politics...
1543575113668235264 2022-07-03 12:39:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 Also: As a guest in China, (and a white guy) I enjoy incredible privilege for many things, a lot of the time. That privilege flows both from society and government policy. Those privileges for me far outweigh the sometimes shitty things like not getting accepted at some hotels.
1543573379109621760 2022-07-03 12:32:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 I don't know what I can say to you.  If you're looking for someone to validate your moral outrage, you're going to have to look elsewhere  I don't feel intentionally targeted or discriminated against and it's just not your business to tell me I should be.
1543558584960573440 2022-07-03 11:33:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @banders80201680 You guys are so insecure lol

1543512925490388993 2022-07-03 08:32:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @planetf1 Nah that registration/permit hasn't existed for years. The hassle comes from the obligation to register you at the local PSB. As a foreigner we have to register wherever we stay, but if you stay in a hotel, they're supposed to do it for you. If they don't want to, we get this.
1543444813978120192 2022-07-03 04:01:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @observer1us I mean I have nothing against TV ads as a concept. But junk food ads and prescription medicine ads are two things specifically I don't think need to be on TV. And seeing them back to back during a sports match is just wild. Bread and circuses while the country burns.

You attract unabashedly racist, literacy-challenged simpletons like dogshit attracts blowflies.  You are defined by the stature of those who find your takes compelling.

1543405021840445442 2022-07-03 01:23:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina lol  And then the Chinese ads are like buy this car! buy these sunglasses! visit this mountain! chew this gum! buy this car!  And now back to the fainting princess.
1543403980361007106 2022-07-03 01:19:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AshinChina @FrancoisOuell15 @Jyves1994 Lol I've got all three pages bookmarked: picture, visa, entry stamp. I hand it over and tell them "I've got all the pages marked you need. Believe me you need all three pages. Don't skip 1 now and call my room in 20 minutes asking to come back down".  They're like "oh...a..ok..."
1543403366453489664 2022-07-03 01:16:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know this isn't a new or unique observation btw.  It's just like 3 times a year when I'm watching a sports event streaming cable online I get to watch American ads and good lord it's grim. Advertising food and pharma on TV is crazy. The reverse culture shock is so real.
1543403360489213954 2022-07-03 01:16:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ads in US be like "check our nEw NeW ICED sUGAR BOMB, this time with ONE BILLION CALORIES, it's so ICED that it's COOL"  And then the next ad is HEY MEN, is that HEART ATTACK stopping you spending time with your grandkids? Take this drug! Don't worry, your dick will still work!
1543387496519966720 2022-07-03 00:13:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 Hm. Different luck then. I've been on the road for a month now and haven't encountered it once in Hunan except for that first one in Changsha. But they're also super chill about covid here in general - for foreigners and Chinese both.
1543240000900280320 2022-07-02 14:27:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhaoxo The Wanxiang International Hotel in Changsha was the designated hotel for that district that couldn't take foreigners. Not sure what makes it international...lol.   ‰∏áÁøîÂõΩÈôÖÈÖíÂ∫ó
1543223798480224258 2022-07-02 13:23:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 Seriously. If you're gallivanting around the country (particularly the countryside) without at least functional Chinese, I feel you're just begging for an "unresolvable" issue to appear.
1543220561148399617 2022-07-02 13:10:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 Hmmm apparently I have no new ideas at all on Twitter.   https://t.co/gMywjj3vQt
1543219817007550464 2022-07-02 13:07:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 Yeah or alternatively you could say it's accidentally discriminatory. There's no intention (but it still can feel like crap).   But if you let that kind of thing affect you, you're just gonna be miserable all the time and end up one of those stereotypical bitter former expats.
1543215726667841537 2022-07-02 12:51:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CJ_Haslett If you don't understand what I said, it's not really on me to say it again for you?  But anyway I just had a look at your profile and from your Twitter behavior you honestly look absolutely unhinged, so bye.
1543213535303331840 2022-07-02 12:42:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CJ_Haslett Yes, not discrimination, like I literally just explained.
1543210113825062912 2022-07-02 12:28:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt Yeah I should have mentiomed avoidance of mafan as a motivating factor stronger than anything else even.
1543207424709910534 2022-07-02 12:18:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> See e.g. my recent case in Changsha where the city-designated "home quarantine" hotel was one that was unable to accept foreigners, because the person who chose the hotels overlooked the possibility of foreigners coming to Changsha. #eyeroll   https://t.co/fx4uq6RY5E
1543207420565934081 2022-07-02 12:18:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Is it discrimination? I don't think so, but I also have a pretty high tolerance for dumb things affecting foreigners.   We were usually just overlooked, or someone was too being lazy to do their job properly, rather than it being intentionally exclusionary or discriminatory.
1543207418506534912 2022-07-02 12:18:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This has been the case for many years. I wouldn't assess whether it's changing for better or worse with anecdotes.  I maintain the same position I've had every time this came up before on Twitter: unless you're brand new to China, you should know and be able to plan around it.
1543207415331508225 2022-07-02 12:18:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. You can also call ahead and confirm.  I've still been able to book places that weren't tagged as "Accepts Foreign Guests" by calling. Sometimes they just skip that setting in Ctrip.  As long as it doesn't explicitly say: "only for locals".  https://t.co/GiH9bve6Aq
1543207404480786433 2022-07-02 12:18:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's my foolproof strategy for dealing with hotels that don't want to take foreigners: I don't.   Step 1: Go on Ctrip, search for hotels and check the box for "Accept Foreign Guests" filter.  Step 2:  Book a hotel.  https://t.co/Qu04JZasW3
1543205726071336966 2022-07-02 12:11:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @2little2lateBB @moghilemear13 @MichaelSchuman If someone in a space gets little/no engagement from their peers, people outside the space can and should take notice.  For another example see N0ah Smith. People in Asia studies see him as a tourist. His audience for takes on Asia is exclusively people who don't know any better.

No Schuman fanboy was ever gonna be like "oh SHIT you're right I'm being IGNORANT". What was I thinking?
1543083937186004992 2022-07-02 04:07:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RJMcGirr @moghilemear13 @MichaelSchuman You used "mainlander" like it's an epithet in and of itself. When calling someone "mainlander" is the punchline, it really reveals how you see them, how you think of them, and how you no doubt talk about them in private company. It's a bad look.
1543081771910045696 2022-07-02 03:58:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RJMcGirr @moghilemear13 @MichaelSchuman But yes, you are certainly the audience....someone outside the China studies sphere.

1543057605982969856 2022-07-02 02:22:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt Yeah definitely. We were there a few weeks ago.
1543057464072867840 2022-07-02 02:22:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu Lol no, it looked like a good way to lose a tooth, bouncing into the basketball rim

1542769969879924736 2022-07-01 07:19:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda 9% is still very high of course. Zixing certainly in better shape economically than other places, as long as they still have tourism infrastructure to build and it remains a good target for domestic consumption.  Love to see a chart of GDP growth before and after 2015.
1542740347989934080 2022-07-01 05:22:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here is the final section about Chenzhou and Zixing, if you're reading this whole thead from the top:   https://t.co/7yrdsN2akD
1542740024697171968 2022-07-01 05:20:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You won't always find a superstar interviewee like Mrs. Xu. You'll have plenty of chats that go nowhere, or only confuse you.  But when you get those amazing talks, it's so worth it. There's NO substitute for it. It's like a window to insight opens in your brain. I love it.
1542740022038003712 2022-07-01 05:20:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I realize that for many, it's a big challenge to get over to China right now, much less get out into the provinces. But if you take your CN work seriously, you've got to do it.  And when you get here, talk to everyone. Ask open questions. Let them ramble. Listen to them ramble.
1542740019265556480 2022-07-01 05:20:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To circle back to my theme that started the story...if you don't take the time to learn about the prefecture-level cities and the even-smaller county-level cities beneath them, you'll ALWAYS be worse at your China-related job.  Sales, consulting, natsec, it doesn't matter.
1542740016610578432 2022-07-01 05:20:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's hard to say whether Zixing is doing well, average, or worse than other county-level cities in China. It's got tourism, but the tourism is lousy recently. Their economy isn't very diversified, so they are vulnerable, but also covid hasn't hit Hunan badly, so they're KINDA ok.
1542740010906324992 2022-07-01 05:20:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh! Speaking of things that may or may not look familiar.  Check out the font for this shopping plaza's logo "Micro Hills City". Especially the M and H...  Also check out this "self-servile bank". No connection to MHC...just a funny typo.  https://t.co/5ISQkPUizL
1542739998797365248 2022-07-01 05:20:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's another firewood cooking place a few nights later. We got duck this time.  Tasty, but probably one of the spiciest things I've had on this trip. And my tolerance is quite high, as you should know.  Last pic is "their" logo. Does it...ah...look...familiar to anyone? üôÉ  https://t.co/7l6C6YWb2W
1542739986348658688 2022-07-01 05:20:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The restaurant built a giant wok into the table with basically a furnace concealed under the table. Staff add wood &amp; cook up a huge pot of fresh fish soup and veggies in front of you.  I'm kinda jaded about gimmicky dining experiences, but this was fun. Rice wine was good too.  https://t.co/4pPuJP16jD
1542739971567931393 2022-07-01 05:20:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And in general, tourist-oriented restaurants in Zixing are still doing ok too (that's my segue to food by the way).  Besides the salmon, which I mentioned before, the other culinary specialty is Êü¥ÁÅ´ food, or food cooked in a giant pot with firewood, rural kitchen style.  https://t.co/m4ZTdmduOv
1542739958372638721 2022-07-01 05:20:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, I feel the city is getting by. More of their tourists come from Hunan and nearby provinces, since few travel across the country and of course the foreign tourists are totally gone.  I didn't get the feeling they were struggling, just treading water and waiting.
1542739954270601216 2022-07-01 05:20:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Awkward segue, but here's one of Zixing's 2 hospitals. That's it; that's the building. Look how cute it is! A bust of Hippocrates out front surprised me.   After-hours I just wandered in. No one around to care.  PCR test results were in a pile at the front desk. Self-serve! lol  https://t.co/BUsuSo3CUj
1542739943373811712 2022-07-01 05:20:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I wish this wheelchair's owner was there to chat with when I walked by. I bet they'd have amazing tales of Zixing to share as they watch dusk fall over the fields &amp; the twinkling lights of the high-rises appear.  Who am I kidding? I wouldn't be able to understand a word they say.  https://t.co/UZm6kLtMrK
1542739930971242496 2022-07-01 05:20:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Zixing is also a great place to observe the EXACT border between China's countryside and urbanized ares. Sometimes it's right across the street.  I've always seen the "high-rises next to fields" situation from trains, but this was my first time walking through it.  https://t.co/32YS8xJN6c
1542739915238154241 2022-07-01 05:20:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Zixing also shows other signs of economic reconfiguration: factories that shut down as the city reorients to tourism.  I passed a few, open to walk in &amp; take a look around. This one used to make cleaning products? I find these pics haunting, like scenes from the US Rust Belt.  https://t.co/YPz1M16wYO
1542739901825036289 2022-07-01 05:20:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back in Zixing, I some similar things: New residential property developments with mostly empty storefronts at the street level.  Developers either overestimated the demand growth for commercial property in this small city, or Covid-induced tourism decline just froze it in place.  https://t.co/GE9UWym9Gs
1542739892152971264 2022-07-01 05:20:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This was originally intended to be a high-end community, with an international kindergarten that never opened and an (empty) boutique grocery that wouldn't be out of place in SH.  I pause to look at a real esate board and a hopeful agent tells me apts here are just 4000 RMB/sqm.  https://t.co/PqfPQz4ZkO
1542739879251316736 2022-07-01 05:20:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He said not all the units are unsold - some of the owners bought the units as ÊØõÂùØÊàø investments, waiting for them to appreciate, but they haven't gained value since travel to Chenzhou is down. Or they can't afford to renovate.  Hasn't cooled this developer's ambitions next door:  https://t.co/XPI58QJMJm
1542739868312563712 2022-07-01 05:20:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I had walked over to the property development to get some food. ONE noodle shop was still open - every other shop had a padlock on the door &amp; a "for rent" sign on the door.  The boss of the one noodle shop told me these apartments were completed in 2019 just before covid hit.  https://t.co/tygVEEtcUi
1542739859345125376 2022-07-01 05:20:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The image above is from a huge property development in front of the Chenzhou West Train Station.  From the train station, it looks impressive, but walking up close, you can see most of the storefronts have no tenants and probably only 30% of the units are occupied.  https://t.co/qeLJO4ImM0
1542739847135502336 2022-07-01 05:20:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Observations on life in a small-city in Hunan - Conclusion!  This is the last thread about Chenzhou/Zixing. It started out as a commentary on the "median Chinese citizen" and turned into an investigation of tourism development.  Now I want to talk about Covid effects and FOOD.  https://t.co/pIrCSeUMLI
1542711106338140161 2022-07-01 03:26:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This same chart is going to look even more striking in another year or two, given China's current rate of new RE capacity additions.
1542671361746685952 2022-07-01 00:48:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting: Mrs. Xu in Zixing said 150M USD (1B RMB) was also how much the Hunan government spent to build Dongjiang Lake into a 5A attraction.   https://t.co/zUGeEJuoAf
1542670313023934464 2022-07-01 00:43:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hey new followers!  If you liked that thread about life in a small Hunan city, you might also like this exploration of Chinese rural economic development and small-town politics in Guangxi from last year.
1542666871022837760 2022-07-01 00:30:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @annieyue2021 Yeah I had È±ºÁ≤â near the train station before leaving yesterday. The guy kept warning me I wasn't going to like it because it's too heavy and oily and spicy but it was totally fine compared to the other oily spicy food I've had on this trip.
1542473372428566528 2022-06-30 11:41:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have one more section to write about Zixing - a look at how Covid has affected the tourist city over the last two years, plus some gratuitous restaurant and food pics.  But that will have to be later. I'm on a hotspot, on my phone, on a train, and we keep going through tunnels.
1542472231791767552 2022-06-30 11:36:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It‚Äôs a story of gradual improvement, picking out a path by trial and error.  "Crossing the river by feeling for the stones underfoot" as some would say. üòâ  In these meandering, tricky journeys, there are surely lessons to learned for other developing countries though.
1542471425042567168 2022-06-30 11:33:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am struck strongly by the complexity and depth needed if you want to faithfully and honestly tell the story of Chinese economic transformation.  Rarely, if ever do you find a story that is clearly black or white, success or failure, an easy framing for a lazy summary report.
1542468314680946689 2022-06-30 11:21:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But, she adds, thanks to tourism and fruit cultivation, replacing fishing, (which was forbidden in 2015) the villages of the "reservoir area" are now some of the wealthiest in Zixing.  Villagers grow fruit and can rent their properties to entrepreneurers who open guesthouses.
1542468311870767104 2022-06-30 11:21:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She answers with a big smile "That's because children eat well now!"  Continuing with the same smile, oblivious to its unsettling contrast with the words she's speaking:  "When I was young, it wasn't that we ate poorly...it was that there was nothing to eat at all"
1542468308913762304 2022-06-30 11:21:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I mention to Mrs. Xu something I've noticed: many people in this area are REALLY short, especially elders. She's quite short herself.  Sometimes you'll see 3 generations of the family walking together &amp; the tallest person in the group will be a 12-year old girl.
1542468305206001665 2022-06-30 11:21:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the way out, I spot more efforts to keep the natural environment as clean as possible: all the tour buses are electric, and the EV parking lot is located directly next to the entrance. Nice perk in the 34-degree weather. The other parking lots are at least 400m away.  https://t.co/0xozy4frRU
1542468285425647616 2022-06-30 11:21:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fortunately my driver on the way back to Chenzhou train station knows: These days, the fish are cultivated on fish farms in the river downstream from the tourist area. In particular the "Dongjiang Salmon".  Yes that's right, salmon. Zixing is famous for its salmon sashimi(!!)  https://t.co/6cgSKAYrv8
1542468245550411777 2022-06-30 11:21:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But funny thing - the fishing doesn't happen here anymore. Mrs. Xu says it's staged, because they don't want fishing boats driving around and polluting the water.   Mrs. Xu doesn't know where the "local fish" on all the restaurant menus come from. Not Dongjiang Lake though.
1542468240777302016 2022-06-30 11:21:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I check up on the details of this story, which of course is totally true cause Mrs. Xu is the best.  The photographer's name is Cao Guangwen and his photography basically created Dongjiang Lake as a travel destination.   https://t.co/9pIWj7Bji3  https://t.co/T6NodSd2bk
1542468218736250880 2022-06-30 11:20:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the way back, we catch a few glimpses of the mist on the river. Where the canyon narrows, it piles up like chunky clouds. Mrs. Xu says the area got famous a decade ago because a photographer from BJ stayed here for a year and took pictures of the fishermen in the mist.  https://t.co/tkPDsvaWO7
1542468191787847681 2022-06-30 11:20:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The lake itself is...pretty nice. Halfway through the boat ride, you can go to the upper deck and take pictures. There are small villages on the banks with fruit orchards. There's a cave on the island but we want to escape the tour group so we skip it and take the next boat back.  https://t.co/e0kRMaRway
1542468173135777792 2022-06-30 11:20:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But I find this craving for ÁÉ≠Èóπ goes too far for my tastes. I don't want my nature trail to be ÁÉ≠Èóπ. I don't need a misty riverfront to be ÁÉ≠Èóπ.  And the ÁÉ≠Èóπ that a group of excited middle-aged aunties on vacation brings to the party is always too much.
1542468170166181888 2022-06-30 11:20:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some of this can be attributed to cultural differences. There's a Chinese word ÁÉ≠Èóπ that means like...bustling, active, full of energy.  Certain places are supposed to be ÁÉ≠Èóπ, like restaurants, plazas, shopping centers. That's why you see restaurants designed as one giant room.
1542468167066611712 2022-06-30 11:20:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Bad sound-related experiences are common in tourist zones. Hiking the canyon, enveloped in the musty smell of earth and water, &amp; the buzz of frogs and cicadas, I round a bend and find a speaker concealed as a stump, blaring a bassy electronic song with a children's chorus. WHY?!?
1542468164059287552 2022-06-30 11:20:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My head was ringing after 5 min. Douyin videos, ringtones, shouting into cell phones held at arm's length, all punctuated by barks from the guide's microphone.  It was claustrophobic and actually anxiety-inducing. It's worth planning your whole trip around avoiding tour groups.
1542468161043582976 2022-06-30 11:20:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The boat ride on the other hand...  This is a good time to talk about one of the great negatives of travel in China: package tour groups. We had the the severe misfortune of sharing the ferry with a tour group of middle-aged women out on a tour group and my GOD they are loud.
1542468154911498241 2022-06-30 11:20:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When you arrive inside the tourist zone, you have the option of taking an ~1hr hike through the Dragon Vista Canyon or a boat ride out to the island and back. The canyon path is a really nice little hike. Fairly steep, but that means less people. Dam visible in the last pic.  https://t.co/CeJYKoZt5v
1542467139583746048 2022-06-30 11:16:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fishing in the new reservoir and fruit cultivation became the new industries.  At first the fruit sold poorly because it had no brand, then the gov't arranged large fruit companies to buy the fruit produced and sell it in the coastal provinces. I had a local plum at breakfast:  https://t.co/2yCqZ6Vybh
1542467105131737089 2022-06-30 11:16:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mrs. Xu said that the gov't tried to help the flooded village economies by introducing new industries. First they tried silkworm cultivation, but those didn't take very well.  Then researchers from a state-owned fruit company came and said the climate was good for fruit.
1542467098076942336 2022-06-30 11:16:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the tourist bus coming in (the road is visible on the canyon wall), the guide introduced the dam,including Dongjiang Lake's role as a clean water reservoir and the dam's role as a peaking power station for the Central Grid.  I took shots from the bus and the boat later.  https://t.co/nmwDeJUdoG
1542467004875304960 2022-06-30 11:16:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's when Mrs. Xu came down to Zixing City - it was too hard to live in the "reservoir area" as the lake was still forming.  This aerial shot is from  https://t.co/5FKFKJG277 and faces south, with the dam/lake to the east, and the river slicing northwest down through the canyon.  https://t.co/IEKpO2S4dY
1542466980426686464 2022-06-30 11:16:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The dam was planned back in the 60s but halted and didn't end up completing until 1986, from a Russian architect's design.  1986-1989 were very hard years for the local villages. There was originally no lake here, so the damming of the river flooded their fields and they starved.
1542466974802124801 2022-06-30 11:15:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So Mrs. Xu was born in the ‚ÄúÂ∫ìÂå∫‚Äù i.e. "reservoir zone" and moved down from the mountain into Zixing city when she was 5 years old.   That's what the old locals call Dongjiang Lake, because before it was rebranded as a tourist lake, it was just a reservoir. I made a map:  https://t.co/NmjH637WGm
1542466944871596033 2022-06-30 11:15:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Basically I was asking the receptionist what conditions in Zixing were like before the 5A tourist rating in 2015 and she was like "Sorry I'm 18 years old...I was a child"   ...and then Mrs. Xu the star was like "I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE NOW" and talked nonstop for almost an hour.
1542466940584984576 2022-06-30 11:15:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay I took a break for a day. Now ready to keep going!  Today I had a really nice chat with one of the cleaners at the hotel, Mrs. Xu.  I was asking some questions of a different receptionist and she didn't know how to answer, but Mrs. Xu overheard! And was very happy to talk.
1542338048809086976 2022-06-30 02:43:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @syeueueur I added her on LinkedIn. Hope she accepts.
1542337746060005376 2022-06-30 02:42:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kadrikarolin What the salty yak milk tea wasn't caffeinated enough for you? :)
1542337002485342208 2022-06-30 02:39:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Pela182 Yeah I can understand that too
1542332232576417792 2022-06-30 02:20:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Pela182 Not even speaking CN will help you if you don't have a qualified masseuse. There's a lot of people doing massage without any formal training, or the years of experience to compensate for not having the formal training. On average, the best results I get are from middle-aged men.
1542331031227084800 2022-06-30 02:15:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qiuwanzheng1 @zhang_schmidt I actually went to ÂçóÊæ≥Âéø in Shantou last year. But I haven't traveled to the other parts of Chaoshan. I know the inland areas of Chaoshan have some famous scenic areas too...would love to see more.
1542326203318935552 2022-06-30 01:56:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaTeacher1 Okay well that's a lot more stuff lol - you have a whole RV to work with! I've got a bag of coffee pouches in my backpack.
1542325859792846848 2022-06-30 01:55:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Pela182 I've had very mixed results going for massages at new places. Sometimes they really know what they're doing, and something it feels like they are just randomly and painfully kneading your bones. Even in SH or SZ, we are quite picky...
1542324660674908160 2022-06-30 01:50:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I brought a big bag of Manner Coffee pour-over pouches for our stays in more remote areas and am now feeling like a goddamn China travel genius.  Excuse me while I now casually pull a shoulder muscle patting myself on the back.    https://t.co/tixWoNE9Rg
1542319222482964481 2022-06-30 01:28:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The mist, the sunrise, the coffee, et vous.  https://t.co/ulSTWIB1oq
1542309049164673024 2022-06-30 00:48:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kakajusaiyou Yeah sure let's connect when I get back to SH. DM me.
1542302478154465280 2022-06-30 00:22:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kakajusaiyou We don't buy or sell any power ourselves since we're a consultancy. We can help them negotiate for different power types so they can meet their carbon reduction and renewable energy targets.
1542147216080781313 2022-06-29 14:05:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tom_grlla Thanks! I'll look into it! I have never thought of myself as a writer - usually on here I tweet stuff about my industry. But a proper writing platform would definitely make more sense for these longer travel/culture threads.
1542097425112104960 2022-06-29 10:47:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just wanted to say thanks all for the positive feedback &amp; nice words on this thread. Even the most well-received content usually attracts a few haters, but I haven't seen any (not yet anyway). üôÉ  I will continue with more comments/pics of Zixing soon. And tomorrow a new city!
1542094472351449088 2022-06-29 10:35:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @centralkingdom My Chinese colleague thought it was a bad joke. She's not on Twitter or anything and has no idea how insane the online discourse is.  I didn't have the heart to tell her all the details, so I just said "oh they must have seen some clickbait from a fake news site".
1542093736368566274 2022-06-29 10:32:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let me kick off the 2022 Dam Collapse Season by saying in advance: The Three Gorges Dam is fine you creeps. Stop spreading these macabre rumors/fantasies about drowning millions of people. It's gross. You're gross.  (Yes bookmark this, because you'll need to QRT it later)
1542092431541555200 2022-06-29 10:27:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Large Japanese company asked us today whether they need to reconsider sourcing hydropower for their SH facility because of the "recent accident at the Three Gorges Dam that caused a collapse."  So yes, it's THAT season again. ü§°
1542070589124268033 2022-06-29 09:00:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @villainousfrnd I guess the wikipedia article you posted calls it an autonomous prefecture.
1542069937321017345 2022-06-29 08:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @villainousfrnd I'm about to make it even more confusing for you. Next I'm going to an "ethnic minority autonomous county" on the prefecture level.
1542007965229543426 2022-06-29 04:52:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hard2decide It was ÂèãÈòøÂõΩÈôÖË¥≠Áâ©ÂïÜÂüé or something like that. But yeah Ê≠•Ê≠•È´ò stuff is everywhere in Hunan. I checked and discovered they're headquartered in Xiangtan so makes sense. They have hypermarkets and shopping plazas and stuff here. I only know they made electronic dictionaries.
1542006627976376320 2022-06-29 04:46:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew Pretty sure electric
1542005557795573760 2022-06-29 04:42:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Y4N6gang Definitely true for those who don't live in China.    https://t.co/QczTOhoqux
1541977840463204352 2022-06-29 02:52:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda And I don't trust anyone who claims they are...lol   https://t.co/lbN1Ss57w3
1541976597242138624 2022-06-29 02:47:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda Thank you! But please don't call me China expert...I don't think anyone can be an expert of a whole country!
1541946938844516353 2022-06-29 00:49:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @binxin Where do you think I got my data? :)
1541936605258166273 2022-06-29 00:08:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @camhawker Then you have bigger fish to fry my friend  https://t.co/k7D4aRYo30
1541928083309023232 2022-06-28 23:34:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt The last few "slice of life" storytime threads I've done have gotten a pretty good response... I'd love to keep doing them if I can.
1541926501288841217 2022-06-28 23:28:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @terencelau Yep, among other linguistic curiosities.
1541813078534541312 2022-06-28 15:57:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nomorebullsh9t For some countries, sure. But I was thinking of contrasting to countries where the capital city holds a huge chunk of the population like Greece or South Korea.   https://t.co/HUU1vxGrX9
1541810685776400384 2022-06-28 15:48:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ebecerra999 Indeed. The numbers are all so abstract...even for me too, and I've been here a while.  If I spent a week visiting each single city with a population over 1M it would take me 2 years, and when I was done I'd probably have to go back and get the new ones that were just added...
1541808561617256448 2022-06-28 15:39:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @coolmusicthough Thanks! I really enjoy doing these threads, even if only a few people end up reading them.
1541808162030100481 2022-06-28 15:38:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Bonan_Me @keanfei47 While in Changsha earlier, I also noted at least 5 domestic car brands that I had NEVER seen before. Just walking down a row of 50 cars in a parking lot, you might see 30 different brands, including many domestic ones. Super fragmented market compared to Shanghai.
1541807716804730880 2022-06-28 15:36:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mpwoodhead Yeah I'd guess a combination of rural revitalization campaigns, poverty alleviation programs, and just general trickle-down of wealth from other parts of the economy finally arriving to small cities. For me, the contrast between small cities in 2011 and now is also huge.
1541806857790304256 2022-06-28 15:32:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaTeacher1 I've also noticed Western-ish bakeries have penetrated all the way down to very small towns. Some things appear to be more readily picked up at all levels of Chn society (like croissants) while other things (eg ribeye steaks, good coffee) are still very much big city things.
1541806047069093888 2022-06-28 15:29:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Heyoooo44262915 @lewenburg Well it's all relative hah
1541805627936509952 2022-06-28 15:28:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jingjing_Li I'm fine with spicy food, but eating it every day for 4-5 days in a row had me ËÖª‰∫Ü. Normally I'm in the mood for Hunan food like...once a month, not every day.
1541805145146916864 2022-06-28 15:26:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SteilacoomDrew I was thinking of foreigners living in China, (i.e. expats) not all non-Chinese üôÇ
1541754649942032384 2022-06-28 12:05:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Like my receptionist - the small town local who doesn't want to move to the big city, away from her family, but also doesn't want to work in a factory, and is delighted that tourism created a job that lets her sit in an AC lobby and watch videos on her phone lol.
1541754301655425026 2022-06-28 12:04:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Too often, I think the conception of the modern Chinese citizen is reduced to a limited cast of stereotyped characters visible in first tier cities: The tech worker. The artist. The migrant worker.  There's a whole different cast of humanity in smaller cities.
1541753637663539200 2022-06-28 12:01:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am intensely thankful for the privilege of being able to travel &amp; work at the same time, exploring the country, filling in bits of knowledge like a paint-by-numbers.  The countryside, the small cities, the big cities, all part of the patchwork of the modern Chinese existence.
1541753633955786752 2022-06-28 12:01:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the factory she could get 3-4k, but it's harder work. Having a tourism industry is a nicer way to stay in her hometown. Otherwise you must leave, like most of her classmates. One went to Changsha and came back after a month. Missed home.  She's never been. Went to SZ once tho.
1541753629639847936 2022-06-28 12:01:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But the new restaurants opened by Changsha bosses are too expensive. They charge the same prices for locals as they do to tourists, which isn't very nice.  She makes just 2k RMB/month (incl. housing) but it's better than going to work 12 hours a day at the electronics factory.
1541753623927222272 2022-06-28 12:01:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The receptionist at our guesthouse is a local. She says all the new guesthouses and restaurants on the river are owned by Changsha bosses, including this one.  She thinks the tourism has been good for the river - it's better maintained and prettier now. But lots of construction.  https://t.co/SRZh0lQtJi
1541753608613801984 2022-06-28 12:01:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Example: About 30km north of downtown is the new tourist town of Zixing - population 320,000.  In 2015, the provincial government got the local Dongjiang Lake upgraded to a 5A tourist attraction. Now Zixing is on its way to becoming a Real Destination. That's why we're here.  https://t.co/XWfDYcuKsN
1541753595082964992 2022-06-28 12:01:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Chenzhou itself is only known for a few things:  1. Having a funny name. ÈÉ¥ chƒìn is a very rare character that only appears in this city's name. It means "a town in a forest" (Êûó‰∏≠‰πãÈÇë).  2. A few natural scenic areas that are "Hunan famous" but not quite "China famous".
1541753591186489344 2022-06-28 12:01:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now allow me to offer a subjective statement here: of all the regions I've traveled to in China, Hunanese efforts to speak Mandarin (i.e. ÊπñÊôÆ) yield some of the most labored, garbled results I've EVER heard. Ethnic minorities in remote villages in Guangxi speak clearer Mandarin.
1541753586786652162 2022-06-28 12:01:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But everyone is intensely friendly. Everywhere I go, a chorus of "Hello! How are You!" &amp; "Â§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫!‚Äù follows. People stare openly until you stare back (except kids; they keep staring).  To my surprise, I hear mostly Mandarin, even from adults. Only old folks are speaking Hunanese.
1541753583515090944 2022-06-28 12:01:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The streets of Chenzhou are an overwhelming cacophony of car horns, recordable mics screaming shop discounts, and wizened chain-smoking uncles dragging up a half-century of tar from their lungs every 5 seconds.  It smells of stinky tofu and motorcycle exhaust and 95% humidity.
1541753577777303553 2022-06-28 12:01:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not even domestic brands are safe.  This local "ode" to a certain famous Changsha tea chain has 26 locations in Chenzhou, according to Dazhong Dianping.  One online review: " ÈúìË£≥Ëå∂Ëàû looks similar to SexyTea...isn't it TOO similar?"   https://t.co/P8sIfvfE2u  https://t.co/7aDHE3ORG6
1541753552938614784 2022-06-28 12:01:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Out on the pedestrian street near the mall, the ancient tradition of giving no fucks about registered trademarks (that has mostly faded away from the bigger cities) is still practiced loudly and proudly. I guess small cities are now the sweet spot for these products.  https://t.co/4BtmZYEaA1
1541753524153098240 2022-06-28 12:00:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The fanciest mall in town has an H&amp;M, a Uniqlo, and a bevy of domestic brands I've NEVER seen in malls in any large cities. There's a wall of street food outside.  No Starbucks, but there's Pacific Coffee. No LV or Gucci; If you can afford those, you have to go to Changsha.  https://t.co/ZdvouKI26u
1541753501856182272 2022-06-28 12:00:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We go out for dinner. The Korean BBQ restaurant has touchscreen ordering. The mall has a trampoline park and a go-kart track and ball pit.  "It's so much more fun to be a kid now in China" is my wife's comment (she grew up in the 90s in a Hubei city even smaller than Chenzhou).  https://t.co/KgQwj8S6OQ
1541753448848572416 2022-06-28 12:00:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "It's good you speak Chinese" she adds. "No one here speaks English. Last year we had a foreigner here for a test, it was very difficult to communicate". (1/year eh?)  I figure there's &lt;15 foreigners in the city. I wonder how they got here. Has this girl really been here 8yrs?  https://t.co/R04Ejw8FAn
1541753435271614465 2022-06-28 12:00:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "This machine is broken. The machine on the first floor is broken too. We have to go to the second floor. The hospital is too poor." the nurse at the Chenzhou First People's Hospital tells me, as I try to scan my barcode to pick up the results of my 16 RMB PCR test.
1541753430473330688 2022-06-28 12:00:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I check some real estate apps. Chenzhou real estate averages ~5-6k RMB/sqm. Nicer places cost 10k RMB/sqm. The fanciest, newest luxury apartment building in town is 21k RMB/sqm.  This is ONE FIFTH the price you'll pay for an old construction, secondhand apartment in Shanghai.  https://t.co/O4MEhL4kdD
1541753415294160896 2022-06-28 12:00:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just as Chn people habitually do when traveling, I ask everyone about house prices.  "Our wages...they aren't high. House prices...they aren't high either. But still expensive, because low wages." says my cab driver. "Chenzhou is poor you know. We aren't wealthy like Changsha."  https://t.co/XVY2XuImCX
1541753395887099905 2022-06-28 12:00:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> People here invariably describe their city as poor (vs. 1st and 2nd tiers, they are) and slow-paced (again, vs. 1st and 2nd tiers, they are).  But even here, there are new shopping malls, clean roads, nice tea shops, universities, well-manicured parks and plazas...  https://t.co/vg3cdOr6Rx
1541753340979474432 2022-06-28 12:00:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> IMO if you do China Studies and ever talk about "average Chinese citizens" (if such a concept even exists) when you discuss e.g., sociocultural phenomena, or Chinese political priorities, you'd MUST be sure to think about Chenzhou and cities like it. Because here they are.
1541753336797724674 2022-06-28 12:00:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Annnnd that brings us back to 4th-tier Chenzhou.  Officially it has 4.5M people, but like most prefecture-level cities in China, that can be misleading.  The 2 urbanized districts of Chenzhou have about 1M people. The rest is suburbs/rural areas.  https://t.co/4RCDz2wmik
1541753309337649152 2022-06-28 12:00:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Subtracting the population of the 1st &amp; 2nd tiers, that's ~600M people living in these 3rd-6th tier cities, (plus about 500M more in the REAL countryside).  So the "median Chinese citizen" across 1.4 billion people should actually be a resident of a small, mostly-unknown city.
1541753304879104002 2022-06-28 12:00:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides those 19 biggest cities, , we have:  - 30 2nd tiers: avg. foreigner should know most - 70 3rd tiers: avg. Chinese will know &gt;half. Foreigners fairly few. - 90 4th tiers: Avg. Chinese will know a few. - 128 5th tiers: ‚ÄúÊúâËøô‰∏™ÂüéÂ∏ÇÂêó?"  China's urbanized population is ~914M.  https://t.co/OvEUMvv8Vb
1541753295529967616 2022-06-28 12:00:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let me start with a framing question:  Where do most CN people live? Big cities? Small cities? Villages?  I was curious. So I summed the populations of all 19 1st &amp; "New 1st" Tier cities in CN, and posted a quiz yesterday.  The sum was 293M, or just 20.7%:  https://t.co/Ux6EhW3FVl
1541753290576531461 2022-06-28 12:00:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd like to share some learnings on small-city China.  For 4 days, I've been in southern Hunan in the city of Chenzhou (ÈÉ¥Â∑û).  Chenzhou is not a big or famous city. But its stories are worth telling anyway.  I'll tell you why in this thread:üßµ  https://t.co/jDN5uAXjhE
1541750178419724293 2022-06-28 11:47:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino I assume it's based on hukou registrations? Maybe?  When they came to our door for the census in Shenzhen, I wonder if my gf was counted for her hukou location (at the time, Xiamen) or her physical location (at the time, Shenzhen)?   Either way it was counted though.
1541749549869707269 2022-06-28 11:45:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Andddd I managed to typo the population of China. Should be 1.412 B, not 1.1412.  But the calculation was input correctly, thankfully.  h/t @FrancoisOuell15
1541748813484163072 2022-06-28 11:42:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Oops, yeah extra 1 slipped into my typing. It's not my twitter without a typo. üòÖ  Good thing I used the right number for the actual calculation

1541739866412949510 2022-06-28 11:06:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I checked the first tiers individually.  Source for the 15 second tiers:  https://t.co/HDt4BdrWYp
1541739754341138434 2022-06-28 11:06:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Looks like about half of you had the basic right idea. And around 20% would be pretty surprised to discover how small the total actually is.  I wish I had made the bands larger though, to see if I could identify how many would have guessed it was 40% or 50%...or more.
1541739232490041344 2022-06-28 11:04:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Answer:  1st Tier Cities: ~83M people 2nd Tier Cities: ~210M people  = 293 Million  Divide by 1.1412 Billion  = 20.7%

There was a way to respond in a smart way, without being juvenile for the adulation of anonymous twitter edgelords, who don't actually get a ironic hard-on when they hear: "fuck the poors to pwn the imperialists lawl".

1541659669068120064 2022-06-28 05:48:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MiaFey61 Alright, here's a few things:  1. Stop hero-worshipping some extremely online snap-back aesthetic that makes you incapable of separating bad takes from good, like when a media figure takes the opportunity to use being poor as a gotcha punchline. It was a bad take. Simple as that.
1541563695356321792 2022-06-27 23:26:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The Canadian chamber of commerce in China has a dedicated slide in their presentations about how Canadian lobsters are the same as Boston lobsters which is pretty funny to me.

1541405570674348032 2022-06-27 12:58:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Quiz time!  If you sum up all the populations of China's 1st tier and 2nd tier cities, what percentage of China's total population is represented?  Remember, there are four 1st tier cities and fifteen 2nd tier (aka "new 1st tier") cities.   (2021 estimates)

1541280975417933824 2022-06-27 04:43:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's an even better one. My god that's a thick Downeast accent.  This accent is disappearing now, but my mother grew up around it and can turn it on and off as she pleases.   https://t.co/Im9OVhaDWF
1541280050523549697 2022-06-27 04:39:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But one thing Maine lobstermen have that Canadians don't is the amazing Downeast accent.  If you've never heard a Downeast accent from central/coastal Maine, this will a surprise for you. Most people think it sounds like it comes from somewhere in the UK:  https://t.co/KiKutsEds2
1541279271649685504 2022-06-27 04:36:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Related fun fact: the North Atlantic lobster is most common known as the "Boston lobster" to CN consumers, which for decades has been a huge point of frustration for Canadian exporters. They're the exact same crustacean. Only difference is the nationality of the lobsterman.
1541276260445605888 2022-06-27 04:24:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Octogenarian_SH @chenweihua Yeah I'm not optimistic either. The accusations against e.g. Hoshine are so flimsy and have no transparency...it's almost like they wanted it to be be impossible to disprove or refute...üôÑ

1541275255943340032 2022-06-27 04:20:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Bonan_Me Yes. And the smart response from Chen could have been: "if you want China to buy more Maine lobster, then get to work in your own Congress to remove those tariffs. This is your fault, not China's" (which I agree with)  and not: "hah hah you are poor" (which is tacky)

1541267184881893376 2022-06-27 03:48:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's it. I don't have any other followup or backup information. Chen's response is stupid.
1541266707733688321 2022-06-27 03:46:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> During the Trump-era trade war, China put a massive tariff on US seafood (including lobsters) which caused lobster trade from Maine (my home state, which is the only reason I care) to plummet.  It is indeed a poor state and lobster is the biggest and most important export.

1540755923333165056 2022-06-25 17:56:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @goingupsoon777 The (liberal) cartoonist is criticizing the decision by saying the US is like a Muslim country.  Which is silly because #1 the decision was made by Christians, behaving in a way normal for Christians and #2 Affected states are now more conservative than any Muslim country anyway.

1540580794795667456 2022-06-25 06:20:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YNWA312 Well. Enrichment yields uranium enriched in U235, which is the normal enrichment-related concern for the anti-proliferation folks. Hiroshima was a uranium bomb.  Plutonium is many steps away from that, via a very different process.  So the logic is fine but the details off.

1540533120050483200 2022-06-25 03:11:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AcuraCake If you have the resources available to to do it, and are unburdened by a desire to "save" the country, I say go for it.  I realize nihilism looks good on exactly no one, but at the end of the day you do what you can to take care of yourself and the people you love.
1540531215333093376 2022-06-25 03:03:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AcuraCake I don't think the Chinese model would work for the USA. Different societies and histories etc. I honestly don't know how to "fix" the US. But it sure doesn't look like exhorting others to vote is the way...to keep going back to the same system that has failed them over and over.
1540530416766963714 2022-06-25 03:00:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AcuraCake Voting in and of itself =/= moral "goodness". It's a tool to achieve an outcome.  The voting in the US currently doesn't translate into governance outcomes that people wanted. It's a nominally democratic machine that manufactures  undemocratic outcomes.
1540528065729613824 2022-06-25 02:51:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu @fncischen Voting in the US appears to serve as a tool to enforce a status quo while tricking citizens into believing they have influence over decision-making.  It's just for people that look like me, it usually turns out ok. I know this is no revelation for people that don't look like me.

1540345862421114880 2022-06-24 14:47:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck No one knows what's going on with inland plants. But geological stability shouldn't be the issue - there's plenty of good sites from a geological perspective. Maybe population density + water source?  Also my pet theory on inland nuke plants: inland coal power prices are too low.
1540345082163122176 2022-06-24 14:44:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EmilNovk2 But I don't know why CNNC would build a plant with CGN's IP and plant design (and not use their own) unless there was some tech sharing agreement I don't know about? So that's why I assume CNP1000. Sadly I've never been to Tianwan 7/8 or had any dealings with them.
1540344232489414658 2022-06-24 14:40:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EmilNovk2 Huh it turns out there's some uncertainty here. Never noticed that before  This database calls them CNP1000:  https://t.co/AHuUADY0xL  But other Chinese sites indeed call them CPR1000 or "upgraded M310" (which I normally take to mean CPR1000).  Only WNA calls them ACPR1000 though

1540334290776768512 2022-06-24 14:01:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's tough to compete up there in Liaoning, where there's lots of cheap wind, oversupply, and coal plants offering combined heat and power that get priority dispatch in the winter. But Hongyanhe has been developing their own CHP plan to compete with that:   https://t.co/VCljFD3sN2
1540333316377034757 2022-06-24 13:57:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pricewise, Hongyanhe 5 and 6 offtake to the grid at a fixed benchmark rate of 0.3749 RMB/kWh, which is equal to the coal base price in Liaoning.   So they (thankfully for them) don't need to compete directly in the wholesale market against cheap Liaoning wind. Not yet at least.  https://t.co/0Mpdz51Cm6
1540333298198921216 2022-06-24 13:57:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There were only 4 ACPR1000s built total: 2 in Hongyanhe and 2 in Yangjiang. Unit 6 took 7 years, uncharacteristically long for China nuclear.  Perhaps the design had some issues that needed to be sorted still, that contributed to the construction delay announced in 2019?  https://t.co/DdOGDVAgRb
1540333288715603968 2022-06-24 13:57:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I say is the LAST, because it is an ACPR1000, CGN's Gen2+ design that is the precursor to the Hualong One.  After 2013, China decided to only build Gen 3 units like AP1000 or Hualong One, but this plant was already approved, so it was grandfathered in.   https://t.co/GJ2oXxsjS7

1539861074828496896 2022-06-23 06:41:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And you can see that Hebei's coal consumption actually started decreasing back in 2019, not-so-coincidentally in alignment with the promotion of the RPS quota. Even though capacity continued to be added in those years.
1539860665476972544 2022-06-23 06:39:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even accounting for the coal in the UHV lines, the overall coal consumption in Hebei is set to decrease, and the consumption of wind/solar is set to increase. That;s he only way it'll meet its RPS targets. But the decrease is very gradual - surely too gradual for many's liking.
1539860079067156481 2022-06-23 06:37:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The positive takeaway here is that we actually forecast Hebei to be consuming a little less of its local coal over the next five years. But then we have to take a closer look at what's arriving as imports via those UHV lines. There's definitely some coal in there too.
1539859578590220288 2022-06-23 06:35:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Import followup point for Hebei: GW are not the same as TWh. Compare this chart to the one I posted yesterday.  The installed capacity looks a certain way, but power that actually gets into the grid and is consumed looks different.  This is why looking at load factor is SO key.  https://t.co/O1wxvHWTPY
1539822250593222656 2022-06-23 04:06:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Yeah demand not subject to the cap (i.e. the power intensive industries) is getting their power at a rate that is more reflective of generation costs.  You can take a look at the spot market prices (which also have no cap) to get a feel for what that look like.
1539821687302410240 2022-06-23 04:04:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Usually the price negotiated is at a discount versus whatever the base price was supposed to be for that province. The generator is ok with this, because those volumes STILL earn subsidies. And in the case of older FiT projects, the subsidy is worth more than the base price...
1539821171742748672 2022-06-23 04:02:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Yes, those volumes are settled through the power markets, but as far as I know, retailers or end users wouldn't have access to it. They're negotiated to be bought by provincial power grids, probably to help meet their RPS goals.
1539819980208087040 2022-06-23 03:57:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Oh. And we never really saw real green premiums in the past because the market price pre-Oct '21 was just...all wacky. Wasn't even really a market, e.g. the coal base price was a de facto price cap, for no good reason.  Prices now better at reflecting both cost and supply/demand.
1539818007106813955 2022-06-23 03:49:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq For an example of a province where the behavior is a little different, check Liaoning. They're swamped with grid-parity wind and the demand is lower, so the green premium has already disappeared, and wind is trading at the same level/even a little cheaper than coal.
1539817541304188928 2022-06-23 03:48:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq As a generator, you can get away with asking for this premium for your power in most provinces, because the demand is there and the supply of grid-parity projects in the wholesale markets is still weak. We see this lasting for at least a few more years until supplies increase.
1539817107340554246 2022-06-23 03:46:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Wholesale markets are pretty much all trading at or close to the base + 20% cap right now because coal prices are high.  If you're one of the relatively few grid-parity RE generators able to sell into the open markets, you have quite a lot of market power right now.
1539816678238089216 2022-06-23 03:44:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Besides this, some FiT projects have part of their power traded via cross-provincial (grid to grid) dispatch settled via the wholesale market, although this is not really merchant behavior because the price is not derived by power auction. It's a special gov't-organized dispatch.
1539816577843236864 2022-06-23 03:44:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds @derznovich @YanQinyq Any green power trading in the markets right now is either:  - Grid-parity projects with volumes that surpassed their guaranteed offtake hours in their grid-parity PPA - Grid-parity projects that already converted completely over to wholesale market (i.e. merchant) offtake

But this is probably mine.
1539476001872580608 2022-06-22 05:10:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And for my nuclear followers:  Hebei has a large nuke plant planned at Haixing which has been approved already for up to 8 units, but it hasn't had its FCD yet, which means it won't appear on this forecast timeline (Unit 1 COD probably 2028 or 2029).
1539474158165573633 2022-06-22 05:03:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Must clarify that this is a *newbuild* phaseout. NOT a thermal capacity phaseout. Thermal capacity will be level to the end of the decade.  I will definitely catch flak for that from someone I'm sure,  and I want to be able to QT myself in this reply here. üòÖ
1539473447767908353 2022-06-22 05:00:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Almost certainly no more coal in Hebei (maybe a few grandfathered projects...have to scour the plans to confirm).  Possibly a handful of gas projects still in the mix before the end of the decade.
1539472868379009025 2022-06-22 04:58:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @damienics Xiong'an definitely a factor. Hebei being a national RE pilot province tied into the overall Xiong'an plan tied into the impending coal peak tied into the proximity to Beijing and the desire to keep those skies blue...

1539470588510879745 2022-06-22 04:49:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Amazing things happening in Hebei.  Proximity to BJ a major factor as to why Hebei's thermal capacity phaseout is starting earlier.  Note that due to variability of renewable generation, Hebei will still be a net importer of power throughout the decade.  https://t.co/icVW211db9

1538813881883435008 2022-06-20 09:19:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This happened at the same time as the SH lockdown, so it got basically no coverage in int'l media (it was covered very lightly domestically).  In the aftermath campus authorities decided to tear down every building built on this plot of land, which is what we saw when driving.
1538812711789727745 2022-06-20 09:15:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A sad sight. We drove past thie pile of wreckage and our taxi driver told us this is where a building collapsed last month, killing 50+ students of Changsha medical school.

1538400042599723008 2022-06-19 05:55:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda If you scratch under the surface of a HK nationalist, you'll always find some variation of the logic: "we should be different because we're superior".  It's exhausting, talking to people in HK who assume I agree with this line of thinking because of my nationality.

1538267054658457600 2022-06-18 21:07:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ddshowerthink Thanks for the links - will review
1538223851951489025 2022-06-18 18:15:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Luofu Actually no, it's not tasteless. It tastes like bitterness and regret. It's the saddest food.
1538223515987771393 2022-06-18 18:13:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Luofu It's a totally tasteless green vegetable that people on diets in the west like to eat...
1538204986211172352 2022-06-18 17:00:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few people have come up with the right answer now.  Here's the list I was consulting (from gov't data).  Overall the north is more obese than the south, and the richer provinces in the north are fattest, while poorer southern provinces are slimmest.   https://t.co/poZ5n8nlEy
1538204577061027840 2022-06-18 16:58:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hx81342240 @freqflyer_ck Maybe the statistics were only calculated according to hukou residents?
1538204424258359297 2022-06-18 16:58:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChineseCa Shanghai is actually very average. Maybe because of all the domestic immigrants.  But yes, you are correct...Beijing is the most obese and Guangxi is one of the two least-obese.   https://t.co/poZ5n8nlEy
1538204185489211392 2022-06-18 16:57:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hx81342240 @freqflyer_ck There ya go.  Guangxi is tied with Hainan btw   https://t.co/poZ5n8nlEy   https://t.co/7NvSUTZpvN

1538202603489992705 2022-06-18 16:50:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hx81342240 skinnier than Guizhou :)
1538202510993018880 2022-06-18 16:50:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Molson_Hart You started out with the right logic yeah
1538202084813983746 2022-06-18 16:48:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hx81342240 50% correct
1538201628930895873 2022-06-18 16:47:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Those are the correct two for least obese! I hope you didn't cheat üôÉ
1538200892071354368 2022-06-18 16:44:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Molson_Hart Overall, the north is more obese than the south, and the richer provinces in the north are the fattest while the poorer provinces in the south are the slimmest.   https://t.co/poZ5n8nlEy if you wanna check answers.
1538199874168045569 2022-06-18 16:40:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KelvinK58193861 Those provinces are correct for rate of being overweight (Ë∂ÖÈáçÁéá), but not obesity rate (ËÇ•ËÉñÁéá) .
1538199275985080321 2022-06-18 16:37:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Molson_Hart Interestingly, Tianjin has the highest rate of *overweight* people in the country (at a stunning 41%), but is only #4 on the obesity rankings.  Guangdong is indeed bottom 5 least-obese, but there are places even slimmer (less wealthy!)
1538198461216346113 2022-06-18 16:34:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @another4224 Oh I wasn't trying to be snarky, just provide a point of context.  China's obesity rate has been on a constant upward curve over the last decade, although it still remains low relative to most western countries.
1538197922252464133 2022-06-18 16:32:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @li__ao You're 50% correct, but I won't tell you which
1538197615296512000 2022-06-18 16:31:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Molson_Hart You thinking about some fat monks? lol  Tibet is one of the slimmest (athough not the very slimmest), and Ningxia is very average (surprising, since the rest of the north is on the chubbier side).
1538196745066524673 2022-06-18 16:27:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @another4224 The most-obese place in China has a similar obesity rate to the least-obese place in the USA (Colorado, at 24%)
1538196437171077120 2022-06-18 16:26:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Molson_Hart Your first answer is within the top 5. Your second answer is within the bottom 10. But neither correct.
1538196057427181569 2022-06-18 16:24:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KelvinK58193861 Those ARE in the top 5 and bottom 5, respectively, but both wrong.
1538195757911908352 2022-06-18 16:23:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RnaudBertrand You're at 50% but I won't say which
1538194469270736896 2022-06-18 16:18:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW I was looking this up because my fianc√©e and I both felt that people in Changsha seem...really slim vs Shanghai.  (Not that checking the national obesity rate is necessarily going to confirm that. But turns out both Hunan and SH are pretty close to the national avg.)  ü§∑
1538193479289180161 2022-06-18 16:14:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There are two correct answers for the second blank by the way. It's a tie at 5.7%.
1538193268143718400 2022-06-18 16:13:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Quiz Time!  With an obesity rate of 25.9%, ____________ is China's MOST-obsese province/region, while at just 5.7% ___________, is China's LEAST-obese province/region.  (The national avg. obesity rate is 11.9%)  First to guess both correctly gets a kale salad.
1538192548933816320 2022-06-18 16:10:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoyuvax It's called "Les √âlites" (by Pizza Hut), and it's actually a FRENCH restaurant.   https://t.co/tYWr1OFKcM  https://t.co/CSzwOgklBN
1538189858690449408 2022-06-18 16:00:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @McardleCurt If I remember correctly, the second picture was actually of a long-closed Pizza Hut in Australia.  But still don't know what the point what. I guess like the state of a country's pizza huts is a proxy for...the health of its society?  He REALLY hates Pizza Hut though.
1538172128104550407 2022-06-18 14:49:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 How about the most literal route...ÊØîËê®Ê£ö?   Kinda catchy imo
1538171770015842309 2022-06-18 14:48:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoyuvax I think this recent store decor rebrand of pizza hut restaurants in T1 and T2 cities is an attempt to re-elevate their image. They've also launched a fine Italian dining concept in Shanghai that's probably a pilot for broader expansion if it goes well.
1538169939676528641 2022-06-18 14:41:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blob_watcher The longer I'm away from the USA, the more bizarre The Discourse looks. Huge chunks of the population sound like their brains have been swapped with a microwaved bowl of rice krispies.

1538097712511746048 2022-06-18 09:54:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Even_Pay Oh I know those are still going on in some form (sans subsidies). They call them floating solar now, which is a very loose definition of "floating"...lol. Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, are all planning to build a ton of it. I wonder what became of the ones that were planned in 2015.
1538096512185827328 2022-06-18 09:49:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Castledaly4 Definitely
1538094708131758080 2022-06-18 09:42:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm very interested in the replicability of these programs. I feel this model should be applicable to other developing countries, but haven't seen too much development scholarship on it.  To be clear: this is purely extracurricular for me. I have no consulting work here.
1538093710273294336 2022-06-18 09:38:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I was planning to do a long thread about how China used solar PV as a rural poverty alleviation tool, but now I'm thinking I should do it as a white paper first.   Instead I will use Twitter to crowdsource content recommendations.  So, what aspects do I HAVE to cover here?
1538072300675035138 2022-06-18 08:13:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GabrielCorsetti Hm haven't lived there for a long time...business trips are usually in and out, 2-3 days maximum.
1538044640330657793 2022-06-18 06:23:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @luoshanji heh yeah that's also accurate
1538029112157442051 2022-06-18 05:21:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Once you start looking, it's amazing what % of shop signs, product packages, and menus in Chinese first-tier cities have both ENG and CN on them. Even if you read CN, it's easy to default to looking at the ENG only.  Nice to come to smaller cities where that isn't possible...
1538028211300605952 2022-06-18 05:17:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @vauzhao @artcrimeprof Your response to a story of a BRITISH general killing and stealing is "but China". Think about that lol.
1538018871306637316 2022-06-18 04:40:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhongguoxin88 Leftist keep telling me that liberals and conservatives are the same, but as long as the ranks of conservatives are filled with demonstrably insane religious evangelicals, I refuse to believe it.
1537847734145024000 2022-06-17 17:20:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino Mmm that makes sense. Foshan is a city with identity and history and culture. Shunde cuisine! Ip Man!  Dongguan didn't become a city until it outgrew Huizhou in the 80s and feels like a collection of factories with a mayor.
1537842311765594115 2022-06-17 16:59:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW is Zhengzhou really nicer than Nanjing? I've never been to Zhengzhou besides Shaolin Temple so it's hard to make judgment call here.  And in my mind Dongguan and Foshan are like...the same place. Huge-ass suburbs of Guangzhou/Shenzhen. Should they be in different sub-tiers?
1537842309651648512 2022-06-17 16:59:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd also find space for Wuxi and maybe Jinan in Tier 2.3.  Now keep in mind I've never been to several of these cities  &amp; haven't seen some of these other cities for like...10 years (should fix that).  So this is subjective and vibes based. Obviously. Don't roast me too hard.
1537842307571265536 2022-06-17 16:59:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Roughly, I think the division lines should be:  Tier 2.1 - Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, Suzhou  Tier 2.2 - Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Tianjin, Changsha, Dongguan, Ningbo  Tier 2.3 - Foshan, Hefei, Qingdao  And I'd probably move Nanjing into 2.1, above Zhengzhou.
1537842304610107392 2022-06-17 16:59:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay so can we talk about these tier rankings?  First, I've never liked the re-branding of "2nd Tier" into "New 1st Tier". Descriptively speaking, they ARE 2nd tier compared to SH, BJ, GZ, SZ. Period.  Second, 15 cities in this category is way too many. It should be chopped up...
1537821763052388352 2022-06-17 15:37:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/3  If you have excellent Chinese and English and a strong CV and are only available to work from another APAC country where we have an office, we can talk about it.
1537821354007089152 2022-06-17 15:35:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/3  I'm serious about the fluent in ENG and CN thing. HSK6+ only please.  We can actually work with you if you have a strong resume and not-so-strong English. But weak Chinese is a non-starter.

This city can't have more than...500 maybe? Between EN teachers, university instructors and a few factory managers?  But I'm not getting stares so they're around somewhere.
1537779145664757761 2022-06-17 12:48:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Across 6 floors of restaurants in this mall, probably 50% is Hunan cuisine. Never seen that in any other cities.  Imagine 50% of a mall in Shanghai being local cuisine lol.  https://t.co/U2bxdg5odi
1537748687853862915 2022-06-17 10:47:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @gnawiur I really liked the steak with roasted marrow at Obsidian in PAFC Mall. Cheesy mushroom pasta great too. Not cheap, but not nearly as exorbitant as some other places in town like Panos or Wolfgang.
1537744357906067456 2022-06-17 10:29:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @gnawiur Oh I went there once...didn't care for it at all. I found the decor very off-putting and the steak had seaweed flakes and white sesame seeds on it - it billed itself as a western steakhouse but seasoned the food like a japanese BBQ joint.
1537721292618870785 2022-06-17 08:58:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @gnawiur Which one? I struggled to find a reliable steakhouse while in was in SZ. The affordable ones were...weird. And the good ones were very expensive.
1537719990002270208 2022-06-17 08:53:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 The green peppers in that dish she was eating are fine - relatively mild spice. They're like Êù≠Ê§í I guess. The spicy ones they've been using as condiments for everything here are the little red ones - they're about equivalent to bird's eye chilis I'd say, and they use a lot.
1537706644561608704 2022-06-17 08:00:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Yeah the food is spicy - even by Chinese standards. It's Hunan after all hah.
1537706484423077888 2022-06-17 07:59:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew All the little noodle shops and whatnot have a vinegar brand called ÁéâÂíåÈÜã that seems to be a local hero.  https://t.co/BE1hpZ2XVE  Hot sauce not common that I've seen. Fresh smashed peppers is a common condiment and thrown into many dishes too. Also pickled radishes.

1537640452417286144 2022-06-17 03:37:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gnawiur Yeah...Wenheyou. We visited and I felt it was frankly...kinda boring. Just hordes of influencer-type girls looking for the perfect selfie angle and very touristy shops. I have a commentary on Wenheyou planned for later in the thread.
1537636530390347776 2022-06-17 03:21:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dali_Yang @JDMayger Yeah if they counted the day we arrived (late afternoon btw) it would be 7, but they also just told us we were ending the quarantine "in advance".   I was wondering if it had to do with BJ's announcement at the time that it was cracking down on "inappropriate pandemic measures".
1537633992018567168 2022-06-17 03:11:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @opticnurv Yeah it's on the list! Was waiting for a rainy day when outdoor activities are off the table. Looks like my wish will be granted soon...  https://t.co/qoMHzxy0Ym
1537633365133651968 2022-06-17 03:08:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JDMayger 7 days in a quarantine hotel + 7 days "home monitoring"which just means tests every few days.   The first 7 days was shortened to 6 for us, for reasons not explained.

1537486227242651648 2022-06-16 17:24:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rapidchair I had several tweets in my draft thread that went on about how dubious the Êñ∞‰∏ÄÁ∫ø rankings are in my opinion, but it was too much of a tangent and I cut it out. But I want to revisit it in another thread soon because it's a fun topic.  I'd like to see Êñ∞‰∏ÄÁ∫ø split into 2 rungs.
1537484433980522498 2022-06-16 17:17:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay, enough for tonight. I will continue soon with more subjective commentary on the city and its development, rather than just vanilla travel blogging. I hope this has inspired some interest in Changsha.  To Be Continued.

1537484411394215937 2022-06-16 17:17:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> SexyTea is super trendy already wherever they open locations in the country (Nanjing is going to get one in August and people are already losing their minds online).  But Changsha's love for their hometown brand is on a whole 'nother level...   https://t.co/cyFdv7EuqA
1537484407342505984 2022-06-16 17:17:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course, arguably the most sucessful Changsha F&amp;B brand nationwide: tea beverage chain Ëå∂È¢úÊÇ¶Ëâ≤ aka SexyTea.  Their market penetration in Changsha is truly insane. In some locations, you can stand in one location and see 4 SexyTea stores by turning in a circle, ALL BUSY.  https://t.co/CYqeL4vPc4
1537484395934023680 2022-06-16 17:16:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Speaking of chains...Changsha has SO MANY LOCAL CUISINE RESTAURANT CHAINS.  There's just one that's gone national (Master Chef Fei aka Ë¥πÂ§ßÂé®). The rest are local heroes, with 5-20 locations.

1537484366301233153 2022-06-16 17:16:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Obviously you gotta try the stinky tofu while you're here, even if you think you don't like it. Two major chains you'll see all over the food streets are ÈªëËâ≤ÁªèÂÖ∏ &amp; Ëë£È°∫Ê°É. They both have high ratings but I've only tried the latter so I can't compare yet.  https://t.co/DavEw1Gbrn
1537484360571813888 2022-06-16 17:16:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But if you want to get food away from the more touristy downtown area, I highly recommend Fisherman's Pier Ê∏î‰∫∫Á†ÅÂ§¥ on the west side of the river, up to the north a bit.   An entire boardwalk full of crayfish, seafood, BBQ, and live music, right next to the river, mostly locals.  https://t.co/O9t7mvxYRC
1537484347443658752 2022-06-16 17:16:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unlike other cities that have been pushing street food out of the city center, a massive chunk of Changsha's downtown is one huge food street, including several landmark attractions like Âù°Â≠êË°ó and Â§™Âπ≥ËÄÅË°ó.  I really love how they've embraced cuisine in their city identity.  https://t.co/giIwaL1WCF
1537484334365835264 2022-06-16 17:16:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The real best thing to do in Changsha is EAT.  It's no secret that China is basically a nation of foodies, but it feels like Changsha is obsessed with its cuisine in a way that I've never seen in ANY other Chinese city (maybe Chengdu or Chongqing are equal).  https://t.co/UPwsWRoNp5
1537484293785948160 2022-06-16 17:16:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Orange Island is also where you can get the best views of the Changsha skyline at night, looking across the river to the east. It's a perfectly pleasant ~4km walk. The Yuelu Mountain trek is a perfectly pleasant 2-3 hour hike.  But honestly 5A is severe rating inflation for both.  https://t.co/l7Z9kqLCfF
1537484286731112449 2022-06-16 17:16:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The major tourist spots in Changsha are Yuelu Mountain, (on the west side of the river) and Orange Island (particularly for the giant statue of Mao Zedong's head as a young man on the south tip of the island).  They are both free(!) and rated as 5A tourist attractions.  https://t.co/G8GsSpsCff
1537484276119523328 2022-06-16 17:16:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The river that runs through the city is the Xiang River ÊπòÊ±ü (which flows into the Yangtze at Dongting Lake).  Changsha's more urbanized districts are on the east bank of the river while the west bank is greener. Orange Island (Ê©òÂ≠êÊ¥≤) is a thin sliver in the middle of the river.  https://t.co/HO9TzosybM
1537484263851192320 2022-06-16 17:16:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Like many of its peers, Changsha is currently in the awkward "we're building a massive metro system that's only half-done so the traffic is just fucking awful all the time" phase of its development.  What they have today in 2022          The eventual plan.  https://t.co/7aaEoBHXGi
1537484248076386304 2022-06-16 17:16:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Changsha of course is the provincial capital of Hunan and the only city in the province with any real weight.   Ask your Chinese friends to name another city in Hunan and a few will remember Zhangjiajie. Ask them to name another beyond that and you'll likely get blank looks.  https://t.co/Zm8LTPBfqo
1537484235078275072 2022-06-16 17:16:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, like all Chinese cities lesser-known outside of China, Changsha is huge. In the 2021 census, its population is a cool 10.2M, making it the 17th largest city in China.  It is classified as a New First Tier City (Êñ∞‰∏ÄÁ∫ø), although frankly that band is too wide...  https://t.co/L6HNDNUjoF

As many of you know, I've been in Changsha for the last 11 days and traveling freely around the city for the last 5. It's basically a new city for me.  This will be my running thread for travel information, commentary, and food porn.  https://t.co/HUGl0Pug7P

1537016727867133952 2022-06-15 10:18:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @luoshanji I'd say its more common than Áü•ÈÅì in Nanjing.  It's actually the word for 'to know' in Nanjinghua and many Nanjingren (and, I assume, other Jiang-Huai speakers) still use ÊôìÂæó in Mandarin.  I would guess, (without knowing) that it's the word for 'to know' in Sichuanese too.

1536968845323550721 2022-06-15 07:08:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg In the Chinese, it said ÂºÄÂ∑•ÁõÆÊ†á2.7‰∫øÂçÉÁì¶, or 270,000,000 kW.  I thought maybe the kW was supposed to be watts instead, but 270MW of pumped storage is way too small.  It feels like it's off by a factor of 10, not 1000. 27 GW is reasonably ambitious and impressive.
1536966747068444673 2022-06-15 07:00:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> FYI @danmurtaugh @luzdingyu
1536966125027995648 2022-06-15 06:57:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Frankly it feels much more realistic that he meant to say 270GW of hydropower, *not* pumped storage.  Even then it would be very aspirational, but at least potentially plausible, with projects like, e.g.:   https://t.co/BNfskWQgX7

1536962954222239746 2022-06-15 06:44:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mm, is it possible the chairman of PowerChina just made an error? 270GW of pumped hydro under construction by 2025 is a ridiculous figure.   These are huge projects that would have to show up in the 5YPs of the respective provinces supposedly building them. Right now they don't.

I guess Changsha was really not expecting any non-Chinese travelers from Shanghai...  It's because they can't offer registration for you at the local PSB.

1535453493498380289 2022-06-11 02:46:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you're curious about the details, the hotel cost 280 CNY/day and the food was 100 CNY/day (20 Breakfast, 40 Lunch, 40 Dinner). It's way out in the suburbs so there was basically no delivery food, and the quarantine food was...not great.  Can't wait for the first proper meal.

1535452398394945536 2022-06-11 02:42:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hunan is supposed to be 7 days hotel quarantine + 7 days 'home monitoring' if you're arriving on the plague train from SH.  If you don't have a home in Changsha, you can book one of the designated "yellow code hotels" (yes I have a yellow code). There's one in each district.

1534899261967863808 2022-06-09 14:04:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Being dense with typos makes my own writing difficult to read too! ü§¶
1534897046381277184 2022-06-09 13:55:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have only skimmed it so far, but hope to read it more closely soon. It legitimately sounds very interesting!  I certainly hope they took more care in preparing their policy roadmap than they did with this FP article, although I obviously now have concerns.  Fin.
1534896905331027970 2022-06-09 13:55:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So that's the piece. No bueno.   The authors have been writing on this topic with regularity and intensity in support of their pet policy roadmap called "climate competition" that they hope the US will adopt vis a vis China.  This plan is detailed here:  https://t.co/k04bONGGxg
1534896818525708288 2022-06-09 13:54:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The article finishes w/ several paragraphs of variations of the theme of "China is an authoritarian dictatorship and untrustworthy on climate anyway".  Because China is a cartoonish Disney villain with no motivation to do bad things other than being evil or stupid. Exhausting.
1534896694021980165 2022-06-09 13:54:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, I'd say there's an aversion to the risk (or rather, near-certainty) of major economic and social fallout inspired by soaring power prices and shortages.  Aw Xi, why'd you have to go and make everyone so risk averse? Live a little why doncha? Look how much fun EU is having.  https://t.co/lJwuvknjSj
1534896590452039685 2022-06-09 13:53:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> CN's reliance on imported oil is real (mostly in the transportation sector).  The electrification of transportation (via coal-generated power) to offset oil imports is a compelling point to support their thesis, if there were evidence of that being the strategy. Is there though?  https://t.co/Ocw2mJce84
1534896292157333504 2022-06-09 13:52:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If they demanded China replace all new coal additions with JUST wind, solar, &amp; nuclear, it would at least be more consistent from a climate perspective, (albeit logistically dubious and economically crippling)  But then the feeble energy nationalism angle would be totally gone...
1534896138318675969 2022-06-09 13:52:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Or, to state the thesis differently:   "China should stop engaging in energy nationalism by using cheap domestic coal and be less nationalist by  building power plants that use the world's most expensive and price-volatile fossil-fuel, in the midst of its supply disruption".
1534895287378276352 2022-06-09 13:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally, the policy suggestion. China shouldn't be building coal because it needs to build more gas, wind, solar, nuclear instead.  But wind, solar, nukes, all have little/nothing to do with imports or foreign dependence.   So really, this is about gas then is it?  https://t.co/qSwhTrHPyb
1534894226768822272 2022-06-09 13:44:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This info is wrong. China abolished the guaranteed wholesale dispatch quota for coal with the reforms last October. Coal now competes in the wholesale markets.   It was a huge deal. If you follow the sector, you have to know this one.  https://t.co/sNwqDO7IXt
1534893205137010688 2022-06-09 13:40:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The next paragraph repeats the same complaint from above. How oh how could China ever be serious about not adding coal after 2025 when it keeps adding coal in 2022? Well I dunno, is 2025 after 2022?  Besides that, China has already been reducing coal's overall role for years!  https://t.co/9J2yWw6UIP
1534893193074196483 2022-06-09 13:40:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most of China's modern coal plants are now built inland because that's where the coal is. Transport to the coasts raises gen costs.   RE: "wealthy, protest-prone coastal cities".  It's the opposite actually. A handful of protests, years old, in villages and small cities. e.g.:  https://t.co/QEcyUAvPMF
1534893184815607809 2022-06-09 13:40:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ah. We've finally returned to the thesis. Energy self-reliance's "siren call" = energy nationalism. Back on track!   Unfortunately the rest of the paragraph is a combination of wrong and misinformed statements that don't support the premise.  https://t.co/4kqmguEsKg
1534893175252619265 2022-06-09 13:40:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Maybe the Party could survive the deadly repercussions of being as gormless as TX grid planners, maybe not, I dunno.  But if you understand how CN's power curbs happened, were resolved, &amp; the subsequent reform measures last year, then this is just pointless wishcasting.  https://t.co/RSOhKW5P0D
1534893167191146498 2022-06-09 13:40:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next.   Insulting really, to suggest technocratic Chinese policymakers would be simple enough to interpret US power disruptions as an outcome of its commitment to renewable energy.  Possibly true for US politicians though.üôÑ  https://t.co/16ZUBYcMYF
1534893159779803136 2022-06-09 13:40:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next paragraph:  China has indeed been worried about energy insecurity for years, but mostly about oil, not coal. The 2005 paper linked in the first sentence says the same.  CN only imports a bit of coal, and only in the last few years.  But yes CN shipping lanes are vulnerable.  https://t.co/DaJCuZPmwd
1534893150707544064 2022-06-09 13:40:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sector people have been discussing for a while whether that 2025 date could have been earlier. With diff. planning, could it have been 2023? 2022? It's a fair conversation!  What's not fair is using "China is doubling down on coal" as a response to "no more new coal after 2025".
1534893147746365440 2022-06-09 13:40:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The dialogue is something like this:  China: We need more power generation. We have big demand growth projections. Our economy needs power. It would be really convenient to build coal  forever but ok fine, we will stop in 2025.  Pundits in 2022: CHINA DOUBLING DOWN ON COAL
1534893144575442945 2022-06-09 13:40:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China has been pretty clear about its targets and objectives for coal in the power sector:  2025: Coal peak. From 2026, no more new coal plants. 2030: Carbon peak. From 2031, carbon emissions should flatten or decline.  The current year is 2022.
1534893141501026304 2022-06-09 13:40:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Construction of new power assets right now, whether they be coal, wind, hydro, whatever, are an attempt to meet the demands of the future grid.  Hebei in 2028 will need the generation assets under construction in Inner Mongolia right now.  And yes, some of it is still coal.
1534893137994596352 2022-06-09 13:40:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But it's not like you can just wave a magic wand and teleport excess power from other parts of the country to the East Grid.  You need a huge generation base in a region with power surplus and a UHVDC line connecting your distant generation assets to your load region.  https://t.co/L9nUKUWx5e
1534893130021240837 2022-06-09 13:40:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China indeed has entered a period of regional energy insecurity. Yesterday I completed a supply balance projection for Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui for the next 5 years. All three provinces will see extremely tight supply and expensive power for a long while. It's rough.  https://t.co/bV4Errbxc2
1534893121972359168 2022-06-09 13:40:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First graf summary. China "doubling down" on coal is related to:  Blackouts: Eh, kinda. Energy security fears: Yes. Great power competition: ? Land war in Europe: ?  The second item is the most relevant. The first a little bit. The other two are just ???  https://t.co/Hydi9sOSax
1534893109741764608 2022-06-09 13:40:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay. Back to this article.  The title asserts that China is building more coal because of energy nationalism.  So based on the common definition of energy nationalism, I guess it's going to demand that China build something else instead...something imported...?  Let's read.
1534893105706848258 2022-06-09 13:40:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In general, it's not bad if you can achieve those things for yourself, but a problem if they are pursued by geopolitical adversaries.  Assertions of "energy nationalism" are often used as a political cudgel to condemn nations for prioritizing their own strategic energy needs.
1534893101898416128 2022-06-09 13:40:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So...here's a super condensed bacground/summary of the 2 main themes characterizing "energy nationalism" in polisci/IR.  1. Energy independence ("our country should be self-sufficient for its energy needs") 2. Energy ownership ("our energy resources should belong to our nation")
1534893097637019649 2022-06-09 13:40:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let's start with the title.  First, what is "energy nationalism"? This is not a term we use in the power sector. No...a word this slippery and amorphous could only be a product of political scientists.  Fortunately(?) this is my background. I've trained for this...  https://t.co/wW9gxmvVgu
1534893081769971712 2022-06-09 13:40:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let me preface this by saying I take no particular glee in tearing down the work of others.  There are real people behind every article, and they (usually) don't deserve the ugliest feedback that might be my first instinct.  That being said, this piece misses the mark. Badly.
1534893075663040512 2022-06-09 13:40:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ANOTHER weak opinion piece on the same topic I covered yesterday.  Unlike the piece I responded to yesterday, however, this piece is so dense with errors to the point and aggressive that it's difficult to read.  Here is a LONG, full response.  Get yourself a coffee... üßµ
1534767787419533312 2022-06-09 05:22:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill So funny thing.  I honestly didn't know who he was 7 months ago when I accidentally ratioed him with a shitpost. And then promptly forgot who he was again until yesterday when someone liked that old reply. I don't even remember this.  https://t.co/R9eTIUs0Kn
1534765965707456512 2022-06-09 05:14:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu @dtcamero199 @malageb @chenweihua brain worms from an anon with 11 followers. Who cares
1534496588542136320 2022-06-08 11:24:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And as a final note:  I am always happy to chat with almost anyone about the CN power sector to help make sure you nail the details, regardless of whether it's news, op-ed, article, whatever.  **Yes even if you can't give me a quote**   Let me be helpful and I'll share all I can.
1534496585702584320 2022-06-08 11:24:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In closing, this is an important and relevant topic but it didn't need to be so negative and IMO really stumbled on the framing and details.  Please don't take this as an invitation to browbeat the author. It's a hard and often opaque sector to cover. I hope it can be better.
1534496582229725186 2022-06-08 11:24:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> IMO, the key question here is "so will China stop building coal plants after 2025 like it says it will?"  On a national level, CN has made no commitments to stop building coal before 2025 (although some provinces have) so it shouldn't be a shock that the building has continued...  https://t.co/2RPEkWTMFO
1534496574042419200 2022-06-08 11:24:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yes, Chinese coal is cheap, but it's actually not *so* straightforward, or they'd have done it already.  Cheap coal at mine mouth in Inner Mongolia is not nearly so cheap after transport to Guangdong, Fujian or Zhejiang.  That's part of why imported coal had a role.  https://t.co/XJp5hzS3JR
1534496566245195781 2022-06-08 11:24:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even though CN coal imports are a fairly small percentage of its overall consumption, the coastal provinces that use imported coal actually need a decent amount of the stuff.  It now appears to be a strategic goal to decrease exposure to volatile int'l markets. Maybe completely??
1534496562822676481 2022-06-08 11:24:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The imports are down overall because prices are up. That's the point of increasing (cheaper) domestic coal production.  Lower prices--&gt; No power shortages. Cause ---&gt; Effect.  The story here, IMO, is that China is maybe seeking to divorce itself totally from foreign coal.  https://t.co/BZjWdUjWq3
1534496555381964800 2022-06-08 11:24:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This bit is just kinda...petty editorializing. I know it's a column but still.  An example of something more nuanced: "it's a rational choice for a country trapped between its own lofty (some might say too lofty) climate objectives and the unforgiving reality of power economics".  https://t.co/QGzGPU5JhF
1534496547844816896 2022-06-08 11:24:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Continuing...  A better way to say this:   "..administration is ramping up domestic production to avoid fuel cost pressure on coal-fired power generators, (especialy coastal generators exposed to imported coal)  which *could* lead to recurrence of power cuts without relief".  https://t.co/VobrGfqsXg
1534496540769013760 2022-06-08 11:24:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course total coal consumption is up, but that's a different point.  I'm talking about framing, and China's 15-year effort to decarbonize and liberalize its energy sector, with all its successes and failures, really deserves a better descriptor than "coal-addicted".  Anyway...
1534496536515825664 2022-06-08 11:24:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ...but honestly I'd prefer we drop the "addiction" metaphor altogether.  Besides being super clich√©d, it's also an uncharitable and poor metaphor to describe a country where coal consumption as % percentage of energy mix has looked like this for the last fifteen years:  https://t.co/8CXXcjibWm
1534496528102195200 2022-06-08 11:24:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thus I find this piece's title disingenous.  If we must stick with this oh-so-tired "addiction" metaphor, it's more like CN brews its own beer and occasionally buys a bit of beer from another guy, but the other guy jacked up his prices so we're not gonna buy his beer now.  https://t.co/rZ8qYRBj6a
1534496511174017026 2022-06-08 11:24:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Unfortunately, I can't agree with the basic framing of this piece. üßµ  While CN is indeed ramping up domestic coal production, it is to *replace* what would have been consumption of imported coal. This isn't a "turn back to coal" so much as a "reshuffle which coal is consumed".
1534465019542663168 2022-06-08 09:19:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Random admission: I always have a moment of mental dissonance when commodities analysts describe fuel prices as being "strong".  Strong is such a positive word, but for the electricity sector, coal or gas having "strong" performance means rising power prices, i.e., a bad thing.
1534433980682227712 2022-06-08 07:15:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China Now that I think of it, you probably know them? Or at least people in the department? As your previous competitors.

1534049268801339392 2022-06-07 05:47:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq Not to be too gloomy, but I can't get enthusiastic about any of this unless I see a plan to have battery storage LCOE fall 30-40% over the next few years and actually compete in power markets (auxiliary services markets aside).   I know that's the objective in the FYP, but...how?
1534046041984872448 2022-06-07 05:34:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ErikSolheim Nothing wrong with celebrating their success, but it's a unique outlier.  Considering Costa Rica has a population of less than 5M and is uncommonly blessed with hydro resources, I expect for most countries the answer to this rhetorical question posed in the video is "no".  https://t.co/UztRCeFmAW

1533901124415422464 2022-06-06 19:58:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @andrey_enright Sorry I missed your question earlier.  These ARE the rates for the big industrial power users if they are still buying their power from the grid company. Otherwise their rate is determined by a PPA with a power retailer (or directly with a generator, if they are large enough).

Like most of China's coastal nuke plants, the site has an beautiful natural environment, nestled between the ocean and mountains.  Ningde is still my favorite though:  https://t.co/al7DnymhzK
1533721001967898624 2022-06-06 08:02:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Taishan NPP of course is still not operating Unit 1, pending news from EDF/CGN on the situation with the cracked fuel rods that made news last year.  The longer we hear nothing, the more it points to a design issue, which is a big headache for everyone.  https://t.co/hqV6MP8SgV
1533720994984394753 2022-06-06 08:02:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's a look at the current frothy nuke plant pipeline for Guangdong.  Guangdong currently has something like 35-40% of all the nuclear capacity in China, but nuclear is only about 10% of its provincial installed capacity.

Not even in the provincial FYP...only the municipal FYP. Site selection now means it's still ~10 years away.  CGN set up the Yangxi project holding company all the way back in 2016.  https://t.co/L9tRbpjKb2
1533720978047770625 2022-06-06 08:02:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Considering there's no target dates for FCD in the 14FYP, I predict CGN would be looking to complete prep work on Yangjiang 7/8 over next 2-3ys and start construction ~2025-2027, with COD around 2029-2030, just in time for the national carbon peak.  Yangxi will be much later.
1533720975195672576 2022-06-06 08:02:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Yangjiang Units 1-6 are Gen 2+ 1000 MW reactors developed by CGN and owned by a consortium of major power developers including a 17% stake by Hong Kong's CLP, which they picked up back in 2016.  I assume Yangjiang 7/8 will be domestic Hualong One reactors.  https://t.co/R7t4TEMB0I
1533720967926906880 2022-06-06 08:02:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> More nuclear! Yangjiang (in Guangdong) announced in its draft 14FYP that prep work will start for two more units at Yangjiang NPP (Unit 7/8) as well as site selection for Yangxi NPP (Èò≥Ë•øÊ†∏Áîµ)  Guangdong is CGN's home province, target of most of its recent newbuild.

1533475639768289280 2022-06-05 15:47:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @liqian_ren Even the public statement of awareness of a problem is a step in the right direction. But yes I agree enforcement is the key question.
1533474820444557312 2022-06-05 15:44:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh Yes that's another point of vagueness bound to cause issues. Is all of Shanghai currently a high risk zone? Medium? Is it split by district? After passing through the train station with thousands of travelers from all over the city, does it matter? üôÑ
1533465941031657472 2022-06-05 15:09:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @phink0 It's the only way to frame this news as something potentially interesting for an audience that isn't in China.
1533465310355156992 2022-06-05 15:06:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh You think something like this qualifies as "arbitrary"?  Currently domestic travelers from SH are greeted with everything from a 3-day quarantine to "no actually it's impossible, don't come" depending on province. üßê   https://t.co/diFKAF2Te6
1533462531674877954 2022-06-05 14:55:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "Sustainable" in the eyes of the powers that be, mind you. Whether you agree with that calculus is up to you.  Anyway that's what I think is a more fitting angle/framing rather than "China is moving away from ZC" which a few people have already jumped to.
1533460906759561216 2022-06-05 14:49:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Honestly puzzled by some of the comments &amp; QRTs that think this is the end of zero covid.  The misuse of these "arbitrary policies" was clearly adding social and economic pressure against ZC. Cracking down on them would serve to make ZC more sustainable, not signal its demise.
1533459177783566337 2022-06-05 14:42:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> All good and reasonable things on face value. The question is about enforceability of course.  The definition of "arbitrary" seems pretty vague, and there needs to be something like a municipal or provincial hotline to report violations. Need an actual channel for recourse.

What a shocking coincidence.
1533046711555624960 2022-06-04 11:23:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wtruszczynska Sometimes the second 7 days is also "home monitoring" instead of "home quarantine", for instance in Hunan. The "home monitoring" may be done in a specific hotel, even if you don't live there. You have a yellow code so you still can't go to some places but you can go outside.

1532725888915152898 2022-06-03 14:08:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Ha. As you can see from this pic tonight, the medical staff have already given up on bulky built-in gloves. I asked where they went, they said "we took them off...Too inconvenient".  So it's not sealed any more....Just a plastic box with arm holes.  https://t.co/KtlF3fKczD
1532654666403975169 2022-06-03 09:25:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg ...and that was what I was able to observe after just 15 seconds standing there getting tested. I'm sure there's more.
1532654518202433536 2022-06-03 09:24:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg In addition to forcing the tester to stand all day, the armholes for the gloves are fixed at a bizarre and unnatural angle and the gloves themslves are oversized, bulky, and lack grips on the fingertips, making it hard to twist open test tubes or peel open the test stick.

1531642922298654720 2022-05-31 14:25:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Apparently Julu Road in front of Atelier is a full-on party right now. My friend says cops are there, not bothering anyone except to make sure people are still wearing masks.  Party in the streets a lot easier when there's still almost no cars lol.

We got two days off from school...More than the snow falling ever got us. :)

1531273924616810501 2022-05-30 13:58:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LightmanYL Without reviewing their Five Year Plan, I'd be shocked if there isn't a bunch of offshore wind planned in there.
1531272439711559689 2022-05-30 13:52:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. So where currently has the most expensive grid power in the nation?  It's a province that A) can't take advantage of the cheap hydropower B) can't benefit from the ramp-up of domestic coal production, and C) that still uses a lot of very expensive imported natural gas: Hainan.
1531272435143954434 2022-05-30 13:52:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. The dark blue line is Qinghai. It's usually the cheapest in the nation, thanks to its huge renewable capacity and low local demand.  4. The green line is Sichuan, which has average-priced power most of the year, but lots of hydro which crashes the price in this rainy season.
1531272432207933440 2022-05-30 13:52:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. The top, grey line is Guangdong. Normally the most expensive grid power in the nation, it will drop to #2 this June thanks to all those imports of cheap hydropower.  2. The light blue line is Yunnan. Normally quite cheap, it will become the CHEAPEST during this rainy season.
1531272428013637632 2022-05-30 13:52:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The answers!  May marks the start of the rainy season in SW China, which boosts hydropower production. The short-term surplus of power drives down grid power prices everywhere that uses or imports hydropower.  This is the key driving phenomenon.  So what are the provinces?
1531250180162723840 2022-05-30 12:24:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 lol if someone tries that crap on my TL, they're gonna hear some words

1531240005758496770 2022-05-30 11:44:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill Here's the secret: the start of the rainy season. Guangdong imports a lot of hydropower fromm Guangxi viva Ultra High Voltage line. Ample hydro in Guangxi = cheap prices in GD, temporarily displacing it from the top of the Expensive Power leaderboards.   https://t.co/OFqvrd3TXS
1531239524604743682 2022-05-30 11:42:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill This is not incorrect logic, since lower demand DOES lead to lower prices. But actually Shenzhen shutting down for 7-10 days wouldn't be enough to create a 2-month sustained drop in power demand for all of Guangdong that would lead to such a price decline.
1531226836520566785 2022-05-30 10:51:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill These are specific provinces this time, instead of regions. As an example, the top line is Guangdong provivnce, which normally has the most expensive power in China, but something happened in the last few months to cause its power to get ever-so-slightly cheaper. üòÑ
1531223921663823872 2022-05-30 10:40:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Aizazadi_ @GregHerczeg @FrancoisOuell15 Yes indeed, the broad backing phenomenon is the start of the rainy season in Southwest China and its impact on hydropower production. Keep going... üòÅ
1531221905587720192 2022-05-30 10:32:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Looks like this is for real!  Notice from the SH gov't came out just about 30 minutes ago.

1531212480508461061 2022-05-30 09:54:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg You've actually named a bunch of correct provinces, but not the correct phenomenon. Not nearly enough snowmelt in most of those provinces you've named :)
1531211699755565057 2022-05-30 09:51:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Rainy season starting in May is an important part of this, but not because of solar.
1531210495289880577 2022-05-30 09:46:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm Yeah! More stuff becoming available in the good to excellent mid-range category in the past few years.  Unfortunately past that there's only Michter's and it's really expensive from the vendors that have it...like 650+ for a bottle.
1531209819784642560 2022-05-30 09:44:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I will reveal the answer in a while, after everyone has had a chance to think about it for a while and test their knowledge.  What one phenomenon would cause power prices to crash in 4 provinces from April --&gt; May? And what would those provinces be?
1531208120898580480 2022-05-30 09:37:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MarkFlegm Unfortunately not from that vendor. I got the WT 101 before from a different vendor on Taobao called Emanuel ‰ª•È©¨ÂÜÖÂà©ÈÖí‰∏ö and they also have the Rare Breed too but I don' think they're in Shanghai.
1531204382989361152 2022-05-30 09:22:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This grid-as-agent scheme for C&amp;I customers will be abolished in 2025, because all C&amp;I power users are obligated to enter the open power market at that time.  But for now, it's an interesting look at how local generation and imported fuels affect provincial power prices MoM.
1531204380053377025 2022-05-30 09:22:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The grid company is supposed to fill this pool by procuring as much low-carbon power as it can via local generation and cross-province imports, then fill the rest with local thermal power.  So the price changes every month, exposed to variability in weather, fuel markets, etc..
1531204377876496384 2022-05-30 09:22:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Remember! This is the grid-as-agent price, NOT the coal base price. It depends on the provincial grid company's monthly cost of power for its power pool.  It serves mostly residential &amp; agricultural power users, but also some C&amp;I users that haven't switched to open markets yet.
1531204375611592704 2022-05-30 09:22:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5: Green: Usually mid-priced, but CRASHES from May-June.  There's ONE power generation phenomenon that explains almost this whole chart. If you know the phenomenon, and some details about the CN power sector, you should be able to guess 4/5 provinces. Fifth one is hard though.
1531204373338267649 2022-05-30 09:22:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. Grey line: usually the MOST expensive power, but not in June. 2. Dark blue: usually the CHEAPEST power, but not in June. 3. Light blue: usually pretty cheap but becomes the CHEAPEST in June 4. Brown: usually fairly expensive but has become the MOST expensive in June.
1531204370112839681 2022-05-30 09:22:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After the popularity of my last China power sector quiz, let's do another one! Test your critical thinking skills!  This chart shows historical grid-as-agent (ÁîµÁΩë‰ª£ÁêÜË¥≠Áîµ‰ª∑) power prices for 5 provinces or regions in China, updated to June 2022. Look at it carefully:  https://t.co/7gEgOkQ6uR

1530103865936596993 2022-05-27 08:29:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece Oh I've thought about it too...  I'd like to do a podcast where we all talk in Chinese and make no acknowledgment of it at all. No big reveal, no shocked reactions. Normalize it, as it should be.
1530101116184457216 2022-05-27 08:18:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thisischaniece I've got a strategy for that...   https://t.co/j3ctbhywKn

We have to report a list of our employees that want to go to the office...
1530044201563729920 2022-05-27 04:32:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Got a notification from my office management in the K11 building that the building will be formally re-opened on June 1.  Many people now assuming that June 1 is the big day when lockdown restrictions will be broadly eased.  I'm gonna hedge my enthusiasm til I see it.

1529869726633328640 2022-05-26 16:59:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @geeblandi I knew more people who were uncertain/untrusting in the early part of 2021 when it was new...but really not anymore.
1529847451498446849 2022-05-26 15:30:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango ÁÇíÁÉßÂåÖ probably would be delicious too, if someone could invent it.
1529846155680829440 2022-05-26 15:25:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @geeblandi And any foreigner I knew who believed this was just somewhere on the spectrum between annoying elitist and straight up racist.  They never had empirical evidence of severe side effects or safety issues...just anti-Chinese vibes. Not people I like being around.
1529845390488793088 2022-05-26 15:22:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @geeblandi Yeah I'm gonna be blunt. If a someone's logic for not using the CN vaccine and waiting was "I don't trust the CN vaccines but I'm ok with non-CN vaccines", I have no sympathy.  I've only met one Chinese who told me this and she's like the most self-loathing person I know.
1529841346487648256 2022-05-26 15:06:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @geeblandi But as it was, the SH outbreak came after the Chinese booster shot was already available for 9 months.  Lucky for the political narrative I guess, since it gives a readily-available and (IMO logical) defense of "it just wouldn't have mattered".
1529840316643438592 2022-05-26 15:02:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @geeblandi IF this outbreak in Shanghai had come at a time when a huge portion of population was only single dosed and hadn't been given enough time to get to their second dose, I think it would be fair to say: "see, if you had just approved Pfizer for use this wouldn't have happened".
1529835280504868865 2022-05-26 14:42:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @phink0 @fortunemal Yeah even with higher vax rates, Shanghai's half-assed rolling mini-lockdowns back in March would likely have eventually failed anyway.  Probably would have taken longer to get to "oh crap we gotta do a real lockdown", and probably the "real lockdown" would have been shorter.
1529833510269513729 2022-05-26 14:35:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fortunemal @phink0 Here it was always incentives...but no punishments. All carrot, no stick.  There could have been so many more measures here, e.g. if you're unvaccinated and you want to take any form of mass transit, you need to show a negative test from the last 48 hours, something like that...
1529830191685836800 2022-05-26 14:21:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @phink0 @fortunemal One of my biggest criticisms is that they haven't been more aggressive in pushing the vaccine, particularly since 3x is necessary.  "we respect our elders too much to force them to vaccinate...but locking them inside for 60 days is ok" this line of reasoning drives me nuts.
1529828470708387842 2022-05-26 14:15:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geeblandi @HarveyZZed The people with severe disease or dying in Shanghai are overwhelmingly unvaccinated.  And Chinese booster shots have been available and pushed to vulnerable populations for 9 months.  mRNA doesn't matter here.

1529786470063812608 2022-05-26 11:28:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @anandcheam Because the vaccine rates are low you doofus.  You wanna sound smart, ask why the vaccine rates are low.
1529784040618082304 2022-05-26 11:18:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed Those should have been conducted well before omicron though, no? Useful for looking at side effects I suppose.

More often than not, they'll yield. They are winging this. They don't have a mandate from SH gov't on what to do...   https://t.co/ojw4OZRuZ8
1529316137409839105 2022-05-25 04:19:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This continues to be the defining factor of the SH lockdown: the decentralized authority that has been granted to the local committees, and the competence of (or lack thereof) of the people wielding that authority.  Before it was for food and testing. Now, it's about going out.

1528908070805716992 2022-05-24 01:17:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima I did Airbnb in Shanghai from 2015-2018. Used to be a nice side gig, but the house listing market was oversaturated after Airbnb's formal launch. A bunch of new listings went up but felt like the numbers of people booking them didn't rise to match it, so booking rates declined.
1528906651818143744 2022-05-24 01:12:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jaapgrolleman @TMK_TinaManiK @hurt_chinese @ChinaDaily Yes, I think these comparisons are premature.

1528905528222830592 2022-05-24 01:07:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YerGonnaLive @jerometenk There was a lot of wishcasting going on at the time. I came in right at the end of that period.
1528904008832004097 2022-05-24 01:01:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jordanschnyc It's definitely getting harder to start your career here, unless you got your degree in China.  Given current wave of foreigner exodus, the state of the foreign job market from supply/demand perspective probably ain't half bad though, if you're willing to take the plunge.
1528888026104860672 2022-05-23 23:58:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe  https://t.co/fRxAYKIvP1
1528767395867013120 2022-05-23 15:58:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway apologies that this thread is not about energy, or electricity, or SH.  It's also also quite a bit more personal than I thought it was going to be when I started writing it, which I very rarely do on here. Maybe I'm losing my mind from lockdown üôÉ
1528767393279127552 2022-05-23 15:58:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's kind of weird, thinking about how different everything would be if I'd first gotten a job offer from a solar firm I'd applied to in NYC or a think tank in DC, instead of a nuclear power consultancy in Shanghai.  And i'm so glad things have turned out the way they have.
1528767383594496000 2022-05-23 15:58:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shit, that just as easily could have been me.  With a different career trajectory that brought me back to the US in 2014, I'd never have the worldview I do now.  Maybe I'd be the one shilling hacky China analysis and calling everyone who disagrees on Twitter a CCP wumao bot. ü§∑
1528767381161799680 2022-05-23 15:58:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think too many China-watching think-tankers, analysts &amp; pundits got stuck in the "know some things, but not enough to have respect for the things they don't know" stage, like an undercooked cake pulled from the oven too early. Looks mostly alright, but the texture is soggy.
1528767377047166976 2022-05-23 15:58:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But if you are unaware of which things you don't even know, you're definitely going to end up with bad conclusions, knowledge gaps.  You won't be able to see how your cultural biases and ignorance have affected your analysis, making you confident when you should hedge.
1528767374455111680 2022-05-23 15:58:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (And just being aware of "unknown unknowns" doesn't mean you're suddenly going to become incredibly wise and nuanced by the way.  After all, Donald Rumsfield infamously used this concept to defend and justify the logic that led to the Iraq War).   https://t.co/Mkjr8EVnI8
1528767371703648256 2022-05-23 15:58:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And this is a common feature for many foreigners who have spent a long time here. I'm not the only one, obviously.  Spending a long time in another country is no guarantee that you'll become aware of ignorance &amp; be able to address your blind spots, ofc. But it's your best shot.
1528767368624996352 2022-05-23 15:58:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know I can still be smug sometimes. I'm always fighting that part of my personality. But this is different.  I'm not trying to say I've achieved higher consciousness or anything. Just that time, awareness &amp; respect for how much don't know has made me a stronger China analyst.
1528767366125207552 2022-05-23 15:58:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If I had gone back to the US at that time to start my career, I would have been become exactly the kind of "China expert" that makes me roll my eyes today on Twitter or LinkedIn.  Enough knowledge to impress people back home, not enough to recognize how little I really knew.
1528767362165805056 2022-05-23 15:58:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Looking back to 2014, today I know I wouldn't like myself much back then.  My perspectives and views on China were exactly what you could predict from a white dude from the US with a few years of Chinese and an MA in IR from a Good School. A smug, overconfident dope.
1528767359703748608 2022-05-23 15:58:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Back when I graduated in 2014, it would have been so obvious and easy to go back to the DC and coast on my creds &amp; what I knew already. I had 5 years of Chinese under my belt, 2+ years of in-country experience, a good degree.  If I did that, it would have been a disaster for me.
1528767357145219072 2022-05-23 15:58:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's the inferred follow-up after all.  Maybe you don't know what you don't know, but, the more you DO know, the more you realize there's a lot you don't know.  The first concept is often attributed to Socrates, while the second is paraphrased from the writings of Aristotle.
1528767354536357888 2022-05-23 15:58:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I've been here 10 years now. The biggest change in my China outlook between 2012 and today is the extent to which I appreciate how much I don't know.  Yes, of course I know way more than before. But I think that's less important than how I gained respect for what I don't know.
1528767351218647040 2022-05-23 15:58:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "You don't know what you don't know".  This is an oft-quoted philosophical axiom in risk analysis  If you KNOW you have a knowledge gap, you can try to account for it, but unknown unknowns will always mess you up.  I feel this issue severely afflicts China analysis. üßµ

1527988558455521281 2022-05-21 12:23:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @coolmusicthough Exactly. And I think that attitude is mainstream with Chinese citizens in SH too..both about willingness to join in collective action and comply with lockdowns and also about growing frustration over lack of transparency and communication.

I'm not supportive of the lack of communication and waste of resources associated which how it's being pursued right now in SH.  Sorry, I'm not going to affirm your biases.

1527977035158945792 2022-05-21 11:38:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geeblandi I think officials are given public health objectives without explicit guidance on how to achieve them.  When the objective is clear but the execution is left open to interpretation (by people maybe not qualified to make those choices) you get weird results.
1527974177613160448 2022-05-21 11:26:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Apparently Jing'an will do PCR tests three days in a row from 22-25. During this period, we are again confined to our homes.

1527267793766232065 2022-05-19 12:39:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh, and if you leave the district (for example, to go to the train station) and then it turns out you can't leave Shanghai (for example, the train is canceled) then supposedly you can't return to your compound for 7 days. I wonder how that works...?
1527266697945567234 2022-05-19 12:35:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Biggest barrier appears to be that you have to secure chopped approval from the local committee in SH and the local committee of the place you're going to before you can buy a ticket.  The friend who went by car paid an agency service a flat fee to handle it all for her.
1527266142460338176 2022-05-19 12:33:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting...I have had 2 friends leave SH for other cities in the last few days - one (Chinese) to Chengdu via car and one (French) to Guangzhou via train.  There's quite a bit of paperwork involved and at least 7-day quarantine waiting for you, but it appears to be doable.
1527262717962334208 2022-05-19 12:19:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This surprised me in the end. Mine (#2) is only about 60% of the total. I would have guessed 9/10.  A surprising number (37%) currently able to leave their compounds in some way.   Just goes to show how hard it is to gauge what's happening elsewhere in the city when locked down.
1527262713650769921 2022-05-19 12:19:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Results!   Total: 184 votes from people in SH.  - 68 can leave their compounds with a pass or otherwise (like they should)  - 88 should theoretically be able to leave but are still stuck inside (like me)  - 28 are mandated to be inside due to recent (last 14 days) cases

Ofc because of our surname and as a joke about how he "drinks like a fish". And then when I was trying to choose a name for my bar, it popped into my head.
1527179529558839296 2022-05-19 06:49:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Worth a read. This commentary on China's plans for a "unified market" is directly borne out by what we're seeing in the power sector.  e.g. The 14th FYP on energy directly says to weaken local protectionist policies, enable more cross-province trading, and unify power markets.

1526964507398254593 2022-05-18 16:34:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @damienics It is indeed a certainly a credit to Wechat's search function that I compare it to Google (which is a true full-functioned crawler + indexer) and not to other social media ecosystem search products like Faceook search. It's far more like a Google anyway.
1526963110825066496 2022-05-18 16:29:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @damienics Oh I don't kid myself that it's common practice. I've Googled stuff in front of people before and sorted by "within the last year" and they go all "whhoaaaaa what's thaaat?"  With some group buy offers going stale in just a few days, it would have been nice to sort by date.
1526960162837504006 2022-05-18 16:17:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @damienics I habitually filter by date on Google to make sure I get results of certain freshness when researching for work, that's just how I am accustomed to using search engines. So I immediately look for (and miss) that functionality on Wechat search. Hope it will be available someday.
1526955197213601792 2022-05-18 15:57:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @damienics I just want the search to be better. Like allow sorting by publish date at least.  Love searching for ‰∏äÊµ∑ÁâõËÇâÈ¶ÖÂõ¢Ë¥≠ and getting a mixture of results from last week and 2017 üòÖ

1526832880097579008 2022-05-18 07:51:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SVKJK93 Many of those coal plants can't afford to turn off the daylight supply glut because they are still needed to ramp up in the evening. Solar curtailment rates are very low now - less than 4%. So they appear to be getting dispatched first.

1526558408039489536 2022-05-17 13:41:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 @pajolicoe I suspected it was a rumor as soon as I saw it, since it was way too different from the plan that was just announced yesterday. And also these days I just don't believe anything that isn't on official letterhead...
1526539998673387520 2022-05-17 12:27:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Even_Pay @blakestonebanks Not saying that it's being implemented in a logical or reasonable manner. Just that they consider it to be part of pandemic control. üòê   These days, if I have to choose between incompetent/illogical covid policy or alternative sneaky master plan, I bias toward the former.
1526538468348039168 2022-05-17 12:21:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laowai_shanghai Yeah it's really hard to be positive overall if you're living in Shanghai right now. Not too much to be supportive of over the last few months, objectively speaking.
1526535366433710080 2022-05-17 12:09:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blakestonebanks NIA has said pretty clearly that restrictions on "non-essential" (whatever that means) cross-border travel are part of covid pandemic measures.  Is there further evidence that this is not the case?
1526501635169456128 2022-05-17 09:55:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the end, does my ranty thread change anything? Nah. DC will always have opportunistic, overpaid, Dunning-Kruger afflicted talking heads confidently tweeting shower thoughts. I'm just venting.  If you're one of my 2k-ish new followers hoping for SH updates, welcome. üôÑ
1526501628898967552 2022-05-17 09:55:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not to say you can't actually grasp some things, even without language skills, if you are reasonably clever, pay attention, have a wide range of authentic relationships and an open, analytic mind.  But if you had all those things, you wouldn't end up tweeting crap like this.ü§¶
1526501622045503489 2022-05-17 09:55:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To answer my own question...ofc he wouldn't. He's asserting guesses as fact, based on what he believes to be insight into the psyche of Chn leadership.   Which he believes he gained, mind you, without speaking Chinese, as an ambassador, under diferent leadership, a decade ago.  https://t.co/h7iiUqMq1l
1526501613258436609 2022-05-17 09:55:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To conclude, I see more evidence for more evidence for: "China will reopen after covid is controlled" and insufficent evidence to support: "the Party will prefer never to fully reopen the country."  And to get back to Mr. Guajardo, even if they did, HOW on earth would he know?
1526501610263678976 2022-05-17 09:55:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sure, you can question whether these covid measures are reasonable, sustainable, logical. I do too.  But if you're gonna assert the authorities haven't actually made these (painful and obviously economically debilitating) choices because of covid fears, you gotta show proof.
1526501607856214016 2022-05-17 09:55:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (BTW it's pretty self-centered to believe SH gov't is lengthening lockdowns to intentionally force out foreigners, like some say.  It's an unfortunate byproduct yes, but if you think you're the focus of a policy affecting 25M Chinese, you might have Main Character Syndrome).
1526501605226319873 2022-05-17 09:55:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But if you're going to tell me that the obvious, transparent, right-in-front-of-you rationale for closed borders (covid! dummy!) is actually a front for the gov't to enforce a long-term disengagement with the world a la North Korea, you have to bring more than vibes as evidence.
1526501602726596608 2022-05-17 09:55:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the end, over and over, the thesis is China's covid measure suck so much that they must have another meaning.  Look. I would love to travel freely too. I haven't seen my family since Dec 2019! This SH lockdown has been long and stupid and incompetent and exhausting.  But.
1526501599694073856 2022-05-17 09:55:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's another:  This Forbes article tries to cite a rationale beyond "China shouldn't be taking covid as seriously as it is".  But the examples cited (Didi delisting, rare earths monopoly) make a stronger case IMO that China wants to enhance strategic substainability.  https://t.co/XSLM3GD2tR
1526501587715100673 2022-05-17 09:55:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So where is this coming from?  Googling, the main evidence I can find for China closing itself off are articles in western MSM, with variations of the same theme:  "They SAY it's about covid, but actually it's really not".   A recent example that provides scant evidence:  https://t.co/lZ41Jax28Z
1526501580781998080 2022-05-17 09:55:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What about security and military?  Well any number of fearmongering think tanks would be happy to tell you that China has most certainly NOT been closing itself off when it comes to security partnerships. In fact, they've been super active...   https://t.co/sxvLi5rysi
1526501578206613504 2022-05-17 09:55:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (Look, I rag on foreign media a lot, but I know at least some you doing your honest best to approach issues honestly. Our personal interactions show me this.  I think China making your lives harder is in many cases a mistake, but not part of a master plan to close the country).
1526501575765553154 2022-05-17 09:55:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You CAN point to media, esp. the large &amp; regrettable exodus of Anglosphere media a few years ago. There's been a bare trickle of J visas this year...tiny positive movement.  But even kicking out *those* journos, and not all, points to targeted retribution, not systematic closure.
1526501573160947712 2022-05-17 09:55:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next, while it's true that in Sino-foreign educational exchange space, the scope of activities has greatly decreased compared to previous years, these decisions mostly aren't being made on the Chinese side.  See: the debate over Confucius Institutes, etc.  https://t.co/gJBsIc6vb8
1526501569100845056 2022-05-17 09:55:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And although BRI investment volumes are much lower than in 2019, pre-pandemic, they still managed to find an impressive ~60B USD in investment activities last year. Which was steady YoY.  Again, curious for a country trying to close itself off.  https://t.co/yJ8RE3l3EW
1526501563874693122 2022-05-17 09:55:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Certainly in my sector (energy) I've seen nothing but growth in foreign investor participation over the past few years.  Chinese wind and solar energy SOEs are *actively encouraged* to spin off equity to the private sector, incl. foreign capital. Working on a case now.
1526501561240678400 2022-05-17 09:55:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next, anyone who follows Chinese investment news could tell you, *even during* the recent 2+ years of covid, we've actually seen a trend of opening up of various industry sectors to foreign invesment  Bizarre for a country trying to close off.   https://t.co/yDDc6uEEZz
1526501558787092482 2022-05-17 09:55:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, how exactly would China "being as closed sa North Korea" square with its political, cultural, economic, or security ambitions on the world stage?  How could China achieve any of these domestic or international goals if it's also trying to sneakily close itself off?
1526501553867067392 2022-05-17 09:55:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is baseless and hyperbolic.  What *non covid-related* measures are there that point to a trend of China closing up like North Korea?  Or that the restrictions on travel for the stated reason of worries about covid transmission aren't REALLY about covid?  A ranty long thread:  https://t.co/xOPS17HBTU

If you can mandate the elderly to stay in their homes and get PCR tested twice a week for 2 months, you can mandate vaccination.  Plus HK has been working on it, with success:   https://t.co/yMqBNums9z
1526281200788119553 2022-05-16 19:19:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LizaBevin Important to distinguish between generation+storage, grid storage, or behind the meter storage.  Here in China, the answer varies a lot depending on economic viability and policies regarding the specific application.
1526248267431874560 2022-05-16 17:08:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ArchemistX lol wut
1526247554115022850 2022-05-16 17:05:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 Alternatively...I could combine the OJ with pineapple juice, some cream of coconut, and some dark rum...shaken with ice...   https://t.co/8riK6OncC2
1526246512938078209 2022-05-16 17:01:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 I have both concentrated OJ and oranges (which can be squeezed). See you in 15?
1526239592357445633 2022-05-16 16:34:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @XiaoLan17 @pajolicoe If you're vaccinated, you're less likely to suffer any of those outcomes.  I described an approach that accomodates the (apparent) reality that we're sticking with ZC while also moving towards an exit. You have to operate within the reality of SH, not a personal fantasyland.
1526187484849184769 2022-05-16 13:07:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread @pajolicoe I mean this has been like 600k cases and 2 months of public health, public image, and economic damage. It dwarfs every other outbreak to date. If this doesn't inspire them to ramp up vaccination, what will...?  Unless there's some secret exit plan that hasn't been shared?
1526184807473876992 2022-05-16 12:56:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @geely_ash @pajolicoe Yeah, outright prevent infection in maybe half the cases and sufficiently reduce the severity for the rest who actually catch it so the final public health burden really does look more similar to the flu.  Otherwise, what's the actual exit plan besides just hoping it goes away...
1526176446552875008 2022-05-16 12:23:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe Exit plan has to be...get back to zero (or near-zero) and then vaccinate the shit out everyone so we can't possibly yo-yo back ever again and this becomes a one-off anomaly.
1526175831109709829 2022-05-16 12:20:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe Unfortunately I think this neverending yo-yo shit is exactly what would happen in SH if we reopened today. 1500 cases would slowly creep back up and we'd hit 10k again in a month.  I'm so sick of this, but not so sick of it that I can't see this as the warning case study it is.
1526173760491237377 2022-05-16 12:12:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @voixdemichele @calbino18 yep
1526171310040432641 2022-05-16 12:02:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 I've been out a few times in the evenings and yes, the workers (and their specific branded drivers, in the case of McD and KFC) are sleeping in the restaurant.  As you mentioned, it's either that or no wages...
1526095296346091523 2022-05-16 07:00:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I hope they make it. It really does seem like we're in the final stretches before reopening and vegetable markets will presumably resume doing good business pretty rapidly.  Insane to me (but not surprising) that SH landlords are still being hardasses even under these conditions.
1526094722527526913 2022-05-16 06:58:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I've noticed that all people working there speak to each other with the same (non-mandarin, non-shanghainese) dialect so I guess they're all from the same hometown. Sharp guy with a good memory. He'll remember you and what you bought last time after just a few visits.
1526090235498885120 2022-05-16 06:40:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 yikes indeed
1526088985432317952 2022-05-16 06:35:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This market is a private enterprise, so the boss rents the space, procures vegetables from various sources, and also rents out some spaces to smaller vendors, including meat, eggs, seafood, or dry goods.  SH SOEs have excused rent, but private landlords have no such policy.

1526063453383049216 2022-05-16 04:54:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danmurtaugh @KarolineCQKan Yeah makes sense. We're consuming the same amount overall but the net volume of packaging associated with that consumption is up.
1526058095553949696 2022-05-16 04:32:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danmurtaugh @KarolineCQKan Surely daily household waste is up, but waste from commercial establishments and restaurants has gone to basically 0?  So are we really generating more waste overall than last month, or it is just distributed in diffferent places than it was prior?
1526056904665214981 2022-05-16 04:28:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Somehow these numbers have to get to 80% nationwide by 2060. There's ah...some ways to go.  RPS is a great tool to slowly move the needle up, a few percentage points at a time. It's like the old aphorism asking how how do you eat an elephant...?   (one bite at a time)  End.
1526056901657915393 2022-05-16 04:28:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And here's the non-hydro RPS results. Obviously quite a bit lower than when hydro is included, but still good progress. Notably, Xinjiang DID just barely hit its targets for non-hydro renewable consumption.  Credit: The Lantau Group  https://t.co/aT2bye71gX
1526056894682787840 2022-05-16 04:28:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Recall that Chhina's RPS is broken down into a general quota for all types of renewables and a specific quota for non-hydro renewables.

So XJ had to buy excess RPS quota from other provinces.  These quotas will continued to be raised annually. The 2030 goal is 40%.   Link:  https://t.co/l0ST9VvkdN
1526056873342173184 2022-05-16 04:28:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hey, some good news about China renewables that I missed!  üßµ  Last month China confirmed it had met its 2021 targets for renewable energy consumption, or Renewable Portfolio Standard. ü•≥  24.9% of the power consumed nationally was from renewable sources.   https://t.co/s0vMIzh9om
1525902626873024514 2022-05-15 18:15:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CramersShirt @TheStalwart If I had to guess I'd say the SH "vision of success" within the zero covid framework looks something like Shenzhen right now. Life almost back to normal, and with very frequent periodic testing (1-2x/week) to keep it that way  ...and then I'd like to see a big vaccine push.
1525901416510140417 2022-05-15 18:10:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And not to put too much of a grey lining on good news but...  I have a sad certainty that many favorite places will not reopen. 7 weeks of no revenue (and only takeout for weeks before that) will be a death blow for many establishments.
1525895951969566720 2022-05-15 17:48:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not as widely-reported but equally important from a positive trend perspective: A few new flights are being scheduled again to fly out of Shanghai airports starting from tomorrow (the 16th).  It's just a handful of the bravest discount carriers, but still...right direction.
1525893541318512641 2022-05-15 17:39:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> All anyone is talking about tonight is the "phased re-opening" of businesses that's supposed to start tomorrow, &amp; what it will look like in practice.  Not sure if excitement is warranted yet - approval to go out still up to local committee.  But seems to be trending positively.

1525351490613051392 2022-05-14 05:45:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I'm currently reviewing a 2019 deck I did for a client where I did the exact same thing for Shandong.  I have another project for them in Shandong now and I'm trying to decide the clever way to adjust the analysis without making it too obvious that the 2019 work had issues. üòê
1525348830551584768 2022-05-14 05:34:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta In Shandong specifically, there's a big problem with captive plant owners refusing to connect to the grid to avoid policy requirements like RPS and surcharges like the renewable energy development fund.  It's illegal but poorly enforced. Not even local gov'ts know the load.
1525347263916040208 2022-05-14 05:28:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta However I did mispeak about the supply/demand balance, if that's what you were referring to.  Although Shandong is a net importer, it would indeed just barely have dispatchable (i.e. subtracting 30GW of captive plants) thermal capacity to meet the evening peak without imports.
1525345575528411139 2022-05-14 05:21:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta What do you mean by "properly responding"?  Thermal plants are running through the daylight trough hours of 50-60GW load when there is no demand for their power, because they need to be online for the evening 88GW peak demand (hoping to turn a 24h profit).
1525315753502617601 2022-05-14 03:23:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MLiebreich @JesseJenkins Surely they would be harder to spot from London?
1525315156988768256 2022-05-14 03:20:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WildeEcon @MLiebreich @JesseJenkins Be that as it may, the burden of proof is to prove the premise, not disprove it.  That's the argumentum ad ignorantiam fallacy and using it here is very dishonest rhetorical framing, particularly when something as serious as slave labor is implied.
1525163165658791936 2022-05-13 17:16:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chef_kenny1 The spot market is relatively new here so these things are more novel for us. üôÇ
1525056569553321985 2022-05-13 10:13:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As a broader lesson overall, this negative spot pricing phenomenon illustrates how hard it is to design and implement power market systems to accomodate massive volumes of RE like China is now building.  So much solar that it's briefly "broken" the spot market pricing algo. üôÉ
1525056566944477185 2022-05-13 10:13:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Keep in mind that industrialized east coast Shandong is a net importer of power overall. During some hours, its peak demand far outstrips local generation capacity. Look at spot prices at 6am or 7pm.  But then at other times it's got a huge surplus.  Tricky stuff to plan around.
1525056564717289472 2022-05-13 10:13:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So nobody is actually paying negative/0 prices for power in Shandong - at least 80% of their power was fixed at some long-term wholesale rate anyway.  But for the 10-20% that WAS exposed to spot prices...that portion was REALLY cheap in April during daytime hours.
1525056558421647360 2022-05-13 10:13:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And in most cases, the party buying the power is not a direct power customer, but a power aggregator. Their business is the retail sale of electricity to consumers.   Their contracts with end-users in Shandong will call for 10-20% of their supply to be exposed to spot pricing.
1525056555959582720 2022-05-13 10:13:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now keep in mind this isn't actually what a consumer pays for power. This is what the pricing algorithm calculates for settlement on next-day supply and demand forecasts..there will be a final adjustment.  Also add price components like the reserve capacity &amp; balancing fee.
1525056552130211840 2022-05-13 10:13:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the last few years, Shandong has quietly become the #1 province for solar in China by installed capacity, thanks to its aggressive installation plan for distributed solar (generally C&amp;I rooftop solar).  So much generation capacity...for 25% of the day.   https://t.co/5PYYjIy49j
1525056549068374016 2022-05-13 10:13:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This automatically calculated result can be attributed to a massive oversupply of power in Shandong last month, specifically during those hours. What causes that?  1. Slightly reduced demand due to covid control policies (a bit)  2. A shit-ton of distributed solar power (mostly)
1525056545016651778 2022-05-13 10:13:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Firstly...well the numbers themselves are no mistake. For at least half of last month, the algorithmically-derived energy price of spot power in Shandong based on supply &amp; demand between the hours of 10am and 3pm was calculated to be NEGATIVE, at the pricing floor (-80 RMB/MWh).
1525056539278856192 2022-05-13 10:13:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> FREE ELECTRICITY?!?   Here's what the Shandong Power Exchange's algorithm spat out for next-day settlement prices in April.   What's going on here? A mistake? Utopia? Is power really that cheap?   Clickbait secured, now you must read the rest of my nerdy thread:üßµ  https://t.co/FnaRFKwv9G

1525031090670292992 2022-05-13 08:32:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 Partially related to how they've convinced themselves that Chinese are downtrodden &amp; brainwashed, and that any act of dissidence, no matter how minor, is a rarity requiring massive courage &amp; deep anger.  When of course Chn people are loudly complaining about things all.the.time.
1524963257504911360 2022-05-13 04:02:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rgmiami2 @EnergyJvd I always get the impression that these people don't see China as a real place, just a conceptual location on a map.  Like if you've visited nuclear plants in China, or any manufacturers along the supply chain, you'd never say "hmm, but can you prove no one here is slave labour?"
1524961983589937153 2022-05-13 03:57:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MLiebreich @JesseJenkins Okay but do you have evidence to support any of these vague implications? You don't get to dump out a gish gallopy list of "bad things that *might* be happening" and shift the burden of proof to someone else.

1524767706808913925 2022-05-12 15:05:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Rogpod13 @the_great_hippo Oh absolutely. They are always seeking the *cheapest* power. On rare occasions, they are also doing a good thing, but it was never the core motivation.  Unless they *specifically* seek out green power (thereby providing economic motive for green generators).
1524761959140556801 2022-05-12 14:42:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Rogpod13 @the_great_hippo And they could even legitimately claim they were both low-carbon and doing the community/the power generators a favor.  Later when they moved to Kazakhstan, they were moving mostly onto low-cost coal overcapacity instead. Doing the generator a favor, but not the environment.
1524761591358828545 2022-05-12 14:41:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Rogpod13 @the_great_hippo Originally the overcapacity was hydropower in SW China. It made perfect sense to welcome in the miners at that time - the region was oversupplied with hydro that had no customers and BTC made perfect sense: it soaked up generation capacity that would have been wasted otherwise.

1523623457237647363 2022-05-09 11:18:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoyuvax ÈùôÈªòÊúü...no going out of the apartment, no deliveries, no group buys. Regardless of the status of the compound.  It seems it's not citywide though - implemented in only some districts or something like that.
1523606314248970240 2022-05-09 10:10:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Shinpath Also, we can't forget that a lot of people in this city have had it much worse. And are way more justified in complaining...
1523605959578624001 2022-05-09 10:09:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Shinpath I think the "not complain" crowd is actually the majority. But the "complain" crowd is a lot louder, and complaining gets more traction on Twitter.
1523600554047700992 2022-05-09 09:47:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mandic_Brothers @AndyBxxx Yeah, this is shocking to me too, because anarchy is such a common form of government around the world and rules are so rare. ü§°
1523593919120162816 2022-05-09 09:21:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 Yeah this one was! We had one three days ago that was...pretty bad. And it was the replacement for the previous one that can canceled after people complained about low-quality pork. We've just been all over the place. ü§¶
1523593012676526081 2022-05-09 09:17:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @calbino18 @laowai_shanghai In our main group, the juweihui announces something and people post nauseating messages of support and appreciation, &amp; then in the side group the same people laugh &amp; compare notes about who managed to post the most absurd flattery in the big group.  Gotta get your kicks somehow.
1523591660239986688 2022-05-09 09:12:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tha1jrf Probably slice into strips and do a quick stir-fry with pork
1523591240071401472 2022-05-09 09:10:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Buki_YGV We have a building committee that has a small direct chat with the local committee secretary. She used to know what was going on and why we were doing it.  Now she doesn't - looks like the decisions are coming from sub-district or higher.  Like if Èò≤ËåÉÂå∫ is able to go out or not.
1523589661029203968 2022-05-09 09:04:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going through this, I, like many people, have found unexpected reserves of fortitude. Those who don't are in for a much harder time. I'm not enjoying this but I'm not going crazy.  On vibes, I'd say disappointed/frustrated stoicism is the most common state in this city right now.
1523579182369820672 2022-05-09 08:22:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ditto for the beautiful lights on Nanjing West Road. Gotta make sure the city looks its best...  (Sorry about the hat, but you don't wanna see what 6 weeks of no haircut looks like).  https://t.co/4PoIHp0P70
1523578490766782464 2022-05-09 08:19:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Someone has been maintaining the hedges and trimming the grass at West Bund.  Just in case you were worried about the city's image declining.  https://t.co/vyuZeuIgd9
1523577019275288576 2022-05-09 08:14:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoli_ya See also more details about food packages in Xuhui:   https://t.co/uUhyO4wBAS
1523576888731762688 2022-05-09 08:13:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @xiaoli_ya That's not true. The entire sub-district (Ë°óÈÅì) gets pretty much the same food in their boxes.  The contents of the package are determined by the budget and choices of the sub-district. I've actually talked about quite a lot:   https://t.co/WSXUtZzNOY
1523575173927948288 2022-05-09 08:06:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On Quxi road I found an outdoor party of what I assume are delivery drivers off duty for the evening, hanging out, eating, drinking, and playing cards on the sidewalk.   They have to be tested daily to maintain their travel passes.  https://t.co/60iBWxkUQs
1523573784044658688 2022-05-09 08:01:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And any time you go off the main roads you'll find delivery drivers sleeping in tents.  I've heard these were drivers called in from other provinces that were supposed to have accommodations but the hotels were full/refused to take them because of infection risk.  https://t.co/PlAJ29u2bn
1523572852829552641 2022-05-09 07:57:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You see these styrofoam box monsters everywhere on the sidewalks awaiting pickup by garbage trucks. Govt food packages have been arriving in these boxes recently.   Note the car for size contrast  https://t.co/C4SVG5r5CI
1523572335101366272 2022-05-09 07:55:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There are quite a few restaurants and shops open now, only offering delivery via online.  Staff have to sleep in the store, which I'm sure is unpleasant, but better than no wages I suppose.  https://t.co/OcIqpXni8p
1523571663232638978 2022-05-09 07:52:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The hotels are all full (presumably with medical staff from other provinces) Jinjiang Hotel parking lot was full of buses and ambulances from outside the city. The ambulance near the entrance in my picture said it was from Wuhan.  https://t.co/tC37ZBRU7n
1523571578994262016 2022-05-09 07:52:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I did go out for a few bike rides in the last few days and got to see a bit of how the city has been operating.   Every fruit store has turned into a bulk order mini warehouse:  https://t.co/NgCcDZA0pS
1523567476453552128 2022-05-09 07:36:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The caseload was streadily trending in the right direction, but has now flattened out, as individual cases keep mysteriously popping up in compounds that have been clean for weeks.  Perhaps that's why the "silent period" of 3-5 days citywide hard lockdown has just been announced?  https://t.co/blYoctUqwP
1523565684235464704 2022-05-09 07:29:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Probably 75% of the city's neighborhoods are now designated as precautionary zones (Èò≤ËåÉÂå∫) which means they have had no cases for 14 day, but in practical terms, whether you can leave your compound is still up to the local committee, and most are choosing to be conservative.  https://t.co/esZov6dgQR
1523564421469007872 2022-05-09 07:23:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Best food box we've received from the government so far (a separate package had meat).  Unfortunately the improvement in food logistics has been accompanied by general decline in communication about lockdown strategy. No one seems to have a clear idea what the plan is anymore.  https://t.co/LWA079vwCA

1523379645789655040 2022-05-08 19:09:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang @przidnt1 Heh had a consulting inquiry from a Russian firm last week. Good thing we couldn't help them...
1523192162204385280 2022-05-08 06:44:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence The referenced document in the screenshots look quite official but I can't find the document anywhere online which is kind of weird...perhaps bogus?  Although I've only done a quick Baidu and Wechat search of the document name.
1523190900306112512 2022-05-08 06:39:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence The issuing body was this mouthful ÂõΩÂä°Èô¢ËÅîÈò≤ËÅîÊéßÊú∫Âà∂ÁªºÂêàÁªÑ‰∏äÊµ∑Â∑•‰ΩúÁªÑ  Something like: State Council's unified pandemic prevention mechanism--&gt;Comprehensive group--&gt;Shanghai working group.
1523190168651321344 2022-05-08 06:36:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence Yeah I've seen a pdf breaking down the analysis, referring mostly to a recent recommendation document issued by a State Council pandemic prevention working group.

1522998302228488192 2022-05-07 17:54:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @barbapple The Chinese vaccines are very effective.  The data from Hong Kong indicate three doses are necessary to achieve the same (actually slightly higher) efficacy as two doses of the Western alternative, which is of course a drawback.   https://t.co/48NERluImz
1522996278850113536 2022-05-07 17:46:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @barbapple Sorry, none of what you just said is true. Vaccine and health data from the recent Hong Kong outbreak showed that pretty clearly.
1522942767512834048 2022-05-07 14:13:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe EVs often have a sleep mode that preserves the battery.  ICE car batteries are going to be in trouble for the owners that haven't been running them for 6 weeks tho. I've seen a few people going downstaris to run their cars for a few minutes but I bet a lot of people aren't.
1522562004313317376 2022-05-06 13:00:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JDMayger Apparently I could go to Beijing right now if I wanted to, with no quarantine, just a negative 48hr test. And a handful of other places too? Might be more trouble to get to the airport than actuall go anywhere though. A nice bike ride perhaps...
1522557651590463489 2022-05-06 12:43:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JDMayger So I always assumed that phrase meant "to be screwed over" without knowing the exact origin of it, and I just checked, and wow.  https://t.co/R5Em7BXSnW

1522486971901562880 2022-05-06 08:02:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonwakter @LantauGroup It's considered low carbon/clean power but generally does not trade competitively in open markets - it still has a fixed offtake rate benchmarked to coal-fired power in most provinces and is bought by the grid.
1522483724881100801 2022-05-06 07:49:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you like this kind of content, be sure to follow me and @LantauGroup for updates, news, and analysis on China and APAC  energy and electricity markets. We are timely and local, with offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Perth, Shanghai, Seoul, Bangkok, and (newly) Kuala Lumpur.
1522483722972725248 2022-05-06 07:49:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Importantly, China has now merged its two domestic certificates, the RCC ÁªøËâ≤ÁîµÂäõÊ∂àË¥πÂá≠ËØÅ and the GEC ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁªøËØÅ into one single-purpose certificate that is blockchain-tracked, non-tradeable, and free of double-counting worries.  This should give MNCs more confidence to buy.
1522483721114615808 2022-05-06 07:49:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Corporations can also install onsite generation (like rooftop solar) but the total generation potential of course is limited according to your roof size.  Renewable energy certificates (both bundled and unbundled) are possible, if the company accepts them in their ESG plan.
1522483718807756800 2022-05-06 07:49:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The barriers I just mentioned mean it can still be tricky for corporations to directly purchase green power in 2022.  Generators and power customers are signing and trying to hedge multi-year contracts for power that will be generated by assets that haven't been built yet, e.g.:  https://t.co/y21KNo7eAr
1522483706199703552 2022-05-06 07:49:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is because they generally don't have the experience/in-house manpower to find customers, market their power, hedge their risk, and balance their delivery obligations via the ancillary services market. They're leaving some money on the table, yes, but it's hard work to earn.
1522483704329019392 2022-05-06 07:49:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The third barrier is most dominant right now. Relatively few zero-subsidy projects are choosing to sell their power in the wholesale markets, even though theoretically offtake rates are higher. Instead, they opt for the (lower) guaranteed grid-parity rate from the grid.
1522483701854380032 2022-05-06 07:49:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The first barrier is probably going to be less of an issue going forward, as China is planning massive investment into building green energy bases inland during the 14th FYP period (i.e. to 2025) plus some 60GW of UHV line capacity to carry that power to the coasts.
1522483698507317249 2022-05-06 07:49:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Point 3: Green power trading has still been slower to ramp up in 2022, due to barriers like: limited available RE volumes eligible to trade in the market, an immature market mechanism for grid balancing, and insufficient RE generator experience to sell power in open markets.
1522483696368234496 2022-05-06 07:49:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Point 2: Other recent policies have motivated corporations to shift to renewable power, especially high-emitting, high-consuming industries. A mixture of "carrot" (power quota incentives) and "stick" (punitive high rates for noncompliance).
1522483694413697025 2022-05-06 07:49:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Point 1: Recent policy actions have pushed renewable power generators to sell their power in competitive wholesale markets, stripping away guaranteed high offtake rates (i.e. subsidies).
1522483691481874432 2022-05-06 07:49:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> NEW publication from @LantauGroup.  Corporate green power procurement in China is growing rapidly and will continue to expand, but barries to quick adoption remain.  Still a big deal for MNCs.

My hypothesis is most people making coffee at home are more inclined to go all the way and be grinding their own beans and have more exacting requirements in general so there's less of a market.

1521726079714865152 2022-05-04 05:39:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @flp_ec Yeah I think they offered it via their mini-app or something like that? I was kinda aware such a product existed, but never saw it, because they weren't selling via Meituan or Eleme. Was very surprised to see them appear on the delivery app. The coffee comes in a combo with milk.
1521725011152695298 2022-05-04 05:34:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Check out the monthly sales volume for a few stores near me in the delivery app. That's for cases, not cups. Today's the 4th.  Most of their stores in the city are still closed, but I bet their unit margins on these bulk products right now are higher than the regular products.  https://t.co/AuxGifzIVb

1520869486400000000 2022-05-01 20:55:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @clicqx But really, my longer point is that SH clearly has some bad problems at the local level of governance, that no one could have guessed before this outbreak. And now we are seeing the issues addressed publically and directly, instead of hiding away from them. Which I think is good.
1520867436912050176 2022-05-01 20:47:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @clicqx The point is that Baidu Baike is usually rarely updated and often has very old info.  This time, the bad officials were fired in less than 1 day and their page on Baidu Baike was immediately updated.  To me it shows SH gov't really wants to show us they are taking some action.

1520827124730720257 2022-05-01 18:06:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And finally a P.S:  Eveywhere is different. I know some people have had very solid experiences with competent local officials in SH. Things were generally run very well in SZ.  I've also met really admirable local officials in rural China, e.g.:   https://t.co/DiDbr312dd
1520826053526421504 2022-05-01 18:02:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And if/when officials are fired, regardless of whether they were truly awful or just a scapegoat, spare a moment to think of the hard-working schlub in the SH Publicity Department who has to update the Baidu Baike article and make everyone knows that Justice Has Been Served. üòÇ
1520826051513155585 2022-05-01 18:02:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think (and hope) we're in the early stages of a deep-cleanse of rot that's going to sweep through each level of SH gov't in the coming months.  There's a lot of simmering anger over the poor performance of local officials and I don't think it will be swept away easily.
1520826049193725952 2022-05-01 18:02:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Or perhaps this was the last straw, after a story broke last week from the SAME SUB-DISTRICT of an local official trying to turn a profit reselling donated food from Yunnan.  Wtf ininBaoshan Zhangmiao sub-districtÔºü  https://t.co/yj07eXDtXp
1520826042872897536 2022-05-01 18:02:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shortly after the videos were posted on Weibo, the story was picked up by Netease and People's Daily, so it was apparent someone was going to be Made An Example Of.  Within hours, the Subdistrict Worker's Committee Secretary,  local commitee Director, &amp; Secretary all got the axe.
1520826040612175872 2022-05-01 18:02:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's not entirely clear why it happened from the news...whether the food wasn't distributed &amp; ended up rotting because of incompetence, or if there was some additional malfeasance going on.  Either way, they were later caught trying to move the supplies..   https://t.co/mYpICwmcti
1520826038447898624 2022-05-01 18:02:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Backstory: Furious residents living in Ê≥óÂ°òÂõõÊùë who had been waiting over a week for a promised vegetable package discovered rotten food and hoarded supplies in their local committee's office yesterday.  Many different videos on Weibo now, e.g.:  https://t.co/tdBWTVELF7
1520826036514336769 2022-05-01 18:02:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I think this story is notable for a few reasons:  1. Everyone knows there's a rot at local levels of Chinese gov't, but I doubt many guessed SH was so bad too. 2. Because it's SH, it becomes a big story when it wouldn't be if elsewhere. 3. Discovery--&gt;firing was like 12 hours (!)
1520826033553182720 2022-05-01 18:02:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hah. Baidu Baike (basically a terrible Wikipedia) has moved at warp-speed tonight to update the profiles of the three minor officials in SH's Baoshan District who were sacked for 'mismanaging' the vegetable supplies in their neighborhood, to reflect that they've been fired. üßµ  https://t.co/VwHqpQ7upI

1520729823911739394 2022-05-01 11:40:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy The post says she was a temporary worker with no permant place to stay, who usually switched housing according to where she was working.

1520332000892432385 2022-04-30 09:19:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So at least for Xuhui, the funds were orchestrated at the district level and came directly out of the sub-districts' (or village's) respective budgets.  Really makes me wonder what is going on in other districts where some people got lots and others got nothing.
1520331996408721408 2022-04-30 09:19:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What does all this cost? The Ë°åËµ∞ÂêÉÁìúÂúà account published what is claimed to be a summary sheet of Xuhui's District's food budget for 12 sub-districts and 1 village.  455,511 households. 300 yuan per household, plus extra discretionary of 1M RMB per sub-district.

1520331909230133250 2022-04-30 09:19:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The property listing says that this 58sqm 1BR apartment listed for 4.9M RMB (oof) in the Xietu Road area (part of Xuhui) has received 15 packages of food from SH gov't.

1520331891320451072 2022-04-30 09:19:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ok this is actually pretty funny.  Some clever SH real estate agents have invented a new sales buzzword: ËèúÂå∫Êàø = a house that is in a neighborhood that gets a lot of free govt vegetables.

It would probably be logistically very difficult to identify and decide who "deserves" free stuff and who doesn't...you'll probably have some conflict no matter what. üôÑ
1520316004781682688 2022-04-30 08:15:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ofc impossible to know for sure whether it was actually the pot-banging stunt from the other evening that added sufficient pressure on the sub-district to change their policy regarding local committee responsiveness and interaction.  But the timing sure is curious.
1520315221914824704 2022-04-30 08:12:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She was quite reasonable and finally provided the interactivity and feeling of having your voice heard by the local gov't that everyone was craving.  Basically said "okay we need to do more testing tomorrow..how would you like to see it organized?" and then agreed to everything.
1520313649847758849 2022-04-30 08:06:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Last night fresh food boxes arrived at our gate for distribution to the elderly.  And the local committee party secretary joined a group chat with building leaders to solicit opinions on how to conduct next round of testing in a way that would make everyone happy.  Coincidence?

Instead of fruitlessly tagging @sciencespo and getting some hapless social media manager, why not directly ask the dean to clarify the school's position on their instructor's terrorism sympathizing?

1519735664715386880 2022-04-28 17:49:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Love how he blames "Pakistani and Chinese trolls" for the Twitter reports (which are clearly coming from Germany in his screenshot).  Like only a "troll" would think celebrating a murderer of civilians is problematic? Fuck all the way off.
1519734709789786113 2022-04-28 17:46:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Don't have to know anything about Balochistan to know glorifying and celebrating a suicide attacker who killed four civilians (including three Chinese teachers) is the behavior of a sick, sick person.

1519653402292416513 2022-04-28 12:22:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @eefjerammeloo It's worth pointing out that in my building at least, the idea that this was coordinated by "foreign forces" was roundly rejected:   https://t.co/e6592fPrKM
1519652472868184065 2022-04-28 12:19:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And, I'm glad to say, the people who wanted to blame this action on foreigners were mostly laughed at.  From our group chat:  "Speaking of foreign power. Actually our building has a lot of foreigners...serving as volunteers They are the real "foreign power".  https://t.co/zKpukq4w78
1519652466757091330 2022-04-28 12:19:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They were in the minority, though. Most people felt a protest on behalf of the elderly (who are more reliant on the gov't care packages since they struggle with group buying) was worthwhile.  Will it have any result? Doubtful, but I guess it helped let off steam for some.
1519652462906703874 2022-04-28 12:19:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There was also a debate in our building's WeChat group. Some people were very against this attention-grabbing trick because it likely wouldn't have any results, and could be broadcast to foreign media and used to smear China. A familiar conversation from Twitter...  https://t.co/OuKmnYYeEC
1519647780582858755 2022-04-28 12:00:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For context, we've recieved only 5 packages, only one with vegetables, while others have received 10+.  Someone made this chart comparing our care packages to a sub-district in Xuhui (which has recieved 12).  So the protest is over inequitable treatment.  (others have gotten 0)  https://t.co/UaYzQTGd4M
1519646044883017728 2022-04-28 11:53:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our sub-district is upset we've only received 5 care packages over 28 days of lockdown. There was a coordinated protest tonight, banging pots &amp; shouting.  Many such videos being shared right now. Thought I'd let Twitter know before someone else makes up a BS story...  https://t.co/pIMg0BkRLA

1519299129125773312 2022-04-27 12:55:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YuxuanMichael You must be counting on your audience being non-Chinese speakers?   At NO point did the officer tell you you couldn't film.  He asked you to stand in a different location if you wanted to film. You answered like a whiny child, seemingly hoping to instigate something. Shameless.
1519298372494311426 2022-04-27 12:52:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg This is infuriating...and so shameless.  He knows the truth doesn't matter, because it will be RT'ed by other non-Chinese speaking journalists dozens of times before a few Chinese-speaking Twitter users can point out that it's a lie.

A random outcome that you might never have guessed when you started YT is that one day an American guy in Covid lockdown in Shanghai would be passing the lockdown days watching your vids and making new cocktails for his Chinese neighbors.
1519018612216188928 2022-04-26 18:20:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @How2Drink Him throwing a tantrum over his insane submarine proposal being rejected and going on a weird personal attack against the coach is pretty much the first thing I always think of when his name is mentioned.
1519007669176389633 2022-04-26 17:37:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhangTaisu Ehh? How are you getting on Â§ñÁΩë and unable to access ÂÜÖÁΩë then...behavior sure seems like a VPN.  Int'l roaming maybe? Or does the hotel provide VPN service?  Weird.
1519003204096524288 2022-04-26 17:19:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhangTaisu It's been the case for me for quite a while that being on the VPN means I can't get on most mainland websites/they load extremely slowly. I think they intentionally throttle traffic detected to be from VPNs. I'm basically cycling on and off it all day for work.
1518992102906265600 2022-04-26 16:35:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @muddletoes @yangliuxh Hopefully something about the inherent high risks associated with juggling eggs? Cause that's where I went at first :)
1518974023124029440 2022-04-26 15:23:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh @urs_maurer That's preserved eggs vs. reserved eggs üßê
1518943723442556928 2022-04-26 13:22:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh I'd assume no single egg would normally spend more than a few weeks hanging out in the "egg reserve".  Under normal circumstances I'd never doubt China's capacity for manpower-centric logistics :)
1518942087273943040 2022-04-26 13:16:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh Similar to how other fresh goods are reserved I imagine, like pork. They cycle the inventory so that nothing in there stays in there for a long time, while ensuring there's still a significant buffer against unexpected demand.

I don't do that, of course, because I don't want to look like a moron.

I moved from Shenzhen to Shanghai 4 months ago. I make observations based on on recent, direct, personal experience.  You, on the other hand, are in Australia.
1518844771363868672 2022-04-26 06:49:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chairman888 @blob_watcher @HanAsra Quickly get on the phone with Suzhou and Jilin and tell them to stop doing it like Shanghai then.
1518841086026084352 2022-04-26 06:35:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @whenipourireign @HanAsra @blob_watcher I really hate it when people use the phrase "when will people learn" to state a personal opinion as if it's a widespread foregone conclusion. It's a silly rhetorical deceit.  You don't know what's going to happen in the next 3-4 months more than anyone else does.

1518589788387164161 2022-04-25 13:56:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JaredTNelson Today we got our paper towel order from JD placed two weeks ago...  Can you get contact fluid via ÁæéÂõ¢‰π∞ËçØ since it's also stocked in pharmacies?
1518575227529474048 2022-04-25 12:58:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh Good summary - probably should have just started by saying that hahah.
1518575035598110725 2022-04-25 12:57:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed Ah yeah i covered salt down in the pantry seasonings section. This was like È¶ôÊñô vegetables.   I've seen a few group buys for salt but I think it'd just be easier to get some from a neighbor?
1518572571033501696 2022-04-25 12:48:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Any time I provided numbers, I was assuming consumption habits for 2-3 people by the way. If you're planning for a family of like...6, obviously make your own adjustments.
1518571526064599040 2022-04-25 12:44:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's a good English-language breakdown of how the group buying works on the two major platforms: Kuaituantuan and Qun Jie Long, plus the private group buys.   https://t.co/WFVJ3X2aaf
1518571523061481472 2022-04-25 12:43:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Other things you'll run out of in 3-4 weeks and wish you had remembered to buy extra of:   hygienic products paper towels, toilet paper, tissues contact fluid toothpaste, shampoo, etc. plastic wrap! any medications of course + aspirin
1518571519290802176 2022-04-25 12:43:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Coffee. Get your shit sorted over for making coffee at home. Either buy and be ready to grind your own beans (and prepare at least a 1-month stock of filters) or buy many servings of the one-cup filter coffees ÊåÇËÄ≥ to make at home.  Group delivery of beans and ÊåÇËÄ≥ is possible.
1518571515260043265 2022-04-25 12:43:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fruit - Appears to vary by jurisdiction. We have had no problem group buying apples &amp; oranges but other people's communities wouldn't allow it.  Fruit doesn't keep long, but most fruit can be frozen. My frozen berries and pineapple are doing fine.   Citrus if you have a bar!
1518571512936427520 2022-04-25 12:43:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you have a sweet tooth, a soda fixation, beer/booze habit, a love for crackers and chips and crunchy things etc., stock up on all that stuff now. You mostly likely won't be able to group buy it and it's not in the gov't packages.  Same goes for cereal and juice.
1518571504128397312 2022-04-25 12:43:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you don't have a water filter/aren't ok boiling water, consider laying in stock of a few extra water jugs (maybe 4-5 of the 20L jugs).  Group buy water delivery is possible but it's really not nice to your building volunteers.
1518571501800554496 2022-04-25 12:43:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Rice/Noodles - Get at least 15kg so you just don't have to worry.  Oil - Get at least 5L so you don't have to worry.  Get fresh bottles/packages of all your seasonings you normally use cause they're hard to get via group buy. Soy sauce, salt, oyster sauce, vinegar, pepper, etc...
1518571499535613954 2022-04-25 12:43:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Bread - Never appeared in our gov't support packages, but usually lots of group buy options. Or make at home!  Flour is uncommon - stock up on at least 5kg and you'll be good for 2-3 weeks. Don't forget baking powder/soda/yeast/sugar if you bake.
1518571497249722370 2022-04-25 12:43:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Butter, cream, cheese, yogurt, etc. are all much harder. Group buys are available but unless you live in a very international building, you won't be able to meet the min. order requirements. Fortunately these things all freeze just fine (except some soft cheese). Stock up!
1518571494791856128 2022-04-25 12:43:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Milk - I hope you like long-life milk (UHT), because fresh milk will be very rare. The gov't does a pretty good job of providing milk and there's always tons of group buys for it, so not hard to get. Oat milk was also very common as a group buy option.
1518571492078145537 2022-04-25 12:43:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Aside from frozen meat, you won't go wrong with cured and smoked meats like sausage or jerky. For example Chinese cured sausages keep for ages and don't take up fridge space. Stock up. The only long-life meat we got from the gov't was Spam, once.
1518571489838387201 2022-04-25 12:43:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meat -   Halal/kosher take note: There's a lot of pork in the gov't support packages and group buys. Chicken less common but also yes. Beef rarest, but always available in group buys.  If you have the freezer space, stock up and freeze it to ensure regularity of animal protein.
1518571485702791174 2022-04-25 12:43:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In general I prefer to cook with canned crushed tomatoes most of the time anyway. If they are high-quality tomatoes canned in-season, they will taste better than fresh out-of-season tomatoes. Try it, I'm serious. Just go get like 12 cans.  And get tomato paste!
1518571483190403073 2022-04-25 12:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fresh veg - nightshade family   Potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers. These were sometimes in the gov't packages and groups, but rarely (peppers rarest). Eggplant and peppers both freeze raw (cut). Potatoes can freeze after being cooked.  I recommend canned crushed tomatoes.
1518571480866787328 2022-04-25 12:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Seasonings.  Basically ginger, garlic, scallions, herbs. The gov't packages neglected these, as did many group buy vendors. Stock that shit up. Garlic and ginger keep for months anyway. You can chop and freeze green onions, although of course not as nice as fresh. Get dry herbs.
1518571478488616960 2022-04-25 12:43:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our gov't support packages usually focused on long-life roots and cole crops like carrots, cabbages, onions. Store those in a cool, dark place or fridge. Probably no need to stock up. But if you do, onions can be cut and frozen. Carrots should be blanched first before freezing.
1518571476244660224 2022-04-25 12:43:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Leafy greens were only occasionally available in gov't support packages and were also very overpriced (if they were even available) via group buying.  So freeze what you can, and maybe lower your expectation of having abundant leafy green veg for a few weeks.
1518571469844152325 2022-04-25 12:43:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fresh veg - I'll broadly split into leafy veg, root &amp; cole crops, and nightshade crops.  Leafy stuff like spinach, ÈùíËèú, etc. all go bad within a few days. If you MUST HAVE, buy them, blanch them, and freeze them in bags. This will only work for hardier greens btw.
1518571467512107009 2022-04-25 12:43:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Eggs - Fresh eggs are always best, but frankly eggs stay good for a month-plus in the fridge, no problem. Estimate your weekly usage, multiply by 4. Buy several trays of 30 and don't worry about them ever again. It's a pain in the ass always ordering eggs.
1518571465071022081 2022-04-25 12:43:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This info is from a combination of personal experience group buying in Shanghai and my experiences growing up on a mostly self-sustaining organic farm (where we canned and froze a lot of vegetables and meat to eat through the winter). But that's a story for another day.
1518571460956409857 2022-04-25 12:43:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (Other SH followers - feel free to add more best practices/tips and tricks for our friends in BJ or wherever who may be heading for a similar lockdown.  Let's hope they handle it better than SH has, but help them be well-prepared just in case they don't).
1518571458561454080 2022-04-25 12:43:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So yeah, this isn't some optimized prepper list for long-term survival - that's not my hobby. This is about a SH-style multi-week lockdown where you'll be unable to leave your apartment, deliveries are limited, and group buying/gov't support packages are the norm.
1518571455742885889 2022-04-25 12:43:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course the most resilient path is to buy months of rice and dried beans and jerky with multivitamins and wait out the apocalypse. But let's assume the usage case is more like a month.  Let's hope BJ doesn't actually come to that, but that's the case that has been set by SH.

1518445427171143680 2022-04-25 04:22:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango All of my reference points for pricing in the US were set back in 2012, when I was still a college student.

1518411111854657537 2022-04-25 02:06:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China Like you can see in the picture, 403's kitchen and bathroom are "across the hall" from their living area, and the path into 404's apartment cuts across the path that 403 has to travel to reach their kitchen (which itself is just steps away from OPs door).
1518410728855990273 2022-04-25 02:05:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China This is an issue specifically accentuated by Shanghai's old lane house construction.

As in Shenzhen is uniquely competent, agile, flexible, and able to deal with an omicron outbreak, in a way that other Chinese cities may not be able to match.

When we're effectively teetering between 0 and 1 cases in our building, every vector, no matter how unlikely, suddenly becomes a point of interest. Fomites via handles of delivery bags?

The SZ app gives you a little gold design on your code when you're vaxxed.  I was reminded some schools require vaccination, which I forgot (no kids ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
1517082593803784192 2022-04-21 10:07:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hiriottappa1 No reason to think otherwise right now.
1517082521921798145 2022-04-21 10:07:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ExNukeGuy Considering the over-budget, over-schedule, and technical issues (multiple cracked fuel rods in the first operating cycle leading to a shutdown) that have afflicted the EPRs at Taishan, I'd be surprised if they're rushing for more right now. But I have no insider intel there.
1517077087718621184 2022-04-21 09:45:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kindofanalyst @xiaoyuvax I've seen there's a great deal of respect for the design of the AP1000 in the Chinese industry. And I've read some evaluations that it's a "true" 3G reactor, whereas Hualong One is a dressed-up 2G+ reactor doing the bare minimum to be considered 3G. But obviously sensitive...
1517074420984344577 2022-04-21 09:35:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dr_King_007 I wanted to feel bad for you, because getting cut off in the middle of your education is awful, but your attitude is really shit.  I went down your page and saw you saying some really ignorant and quite racist things about Chinese people. Think they'd be wise to keep you out.
1517072941552631809 2022-04-21 09:29:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dr_King_007 Dude, you're never going to make it back to China if you keep consuming all this biased or inaccurate bullshit posted online.  I tried to engage in good faith. You just wanna fuck around, that's your problem. Have a nice day, and good luck with your half-finished degree. üòâ
1517070985329246209 2022-04-21 09:21:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dr_King_007 Yes, that's true, but schools requiring their students to be vaccinated doesn't have much bearing on the crucial population group who need to be vaccinated: the elderly. That's the group that matters most, and no  one is forcing them.  Use some respect when you talk to me please.
1517070162427793408 2022-04-21 09:18:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sanverde Er, health kit app changes color based on travel history, no? Not vaccination status.  At least none of the QR codes I've used in the last year had any practical real world function associated with your vaccination status (unless a private business required it).
1517069265572331520 2022-04-21 09:14:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dr_King_007 QR codes change color if you've traveled to an area with an virus outbreak, or are considered high risk (e.g. during your quarantine period).  They don't change color or do anything different based on your vaccine status (they track it yes, but there's no associated function).
1517067973638619137 2022-04-21 09:09:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kindofanalyst Yeah I honestly didn't expect that "should we build CAP1000 or CAP1400?" was a question that would ever come up.  I just assumed it would be all CAP1400 once Shidaowan was done (and maybe that still will be the case, but they can't wait now for it to finish to build more...).
1517066809140445184 2022-04-21 09:04:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere BJ has cajoled, prodded, pushed, and incentivized vaccination, but not outright mandated, sure.   If you were steadfast in your determination to not vaccinate (and your work/school didn't require it) then, no, you don't have to be, even today.  But the forces are clearly present.
1517062609060909056 2022-04-21 08:48:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kindofanalyst Ah yeah sure. I was mostly looking to draw a distinction between AP1000 tech tree and Hualong One tech tree, and that it's the former and not the latter. I agree that WEC won't see much out of this (except bragging rights they'll undoubtedly claim on their marketing materials).
1517061942091075584 2022-04-21 08:45:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 Well, a localized supply chain variant of the AP1000, to be precise (i.e. the CAP1000, as was pointed out elsewhere here) but definitely not a departure for the Hualong One tech instead.  And supposedly there's still some debate over whether Lufeng could still be one as well (!)
1517060987505225728 2022-04-21 08:41:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kindofanalyst Well yes, sure. But if you know that, then you also know it's largely the design, but with a localized supply chain.

1516718231528288256 2022-04-20 09:59:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed Oh yes that's right, didn't count the first day properly lol
1516715780511272962 2022-04-20 09:49:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AndyBxxx Good news! If you are in the minority of people that believe Chongming and Jinshan are even IN Shanghai (heh heh).
1516696606783176704 2022-04-20 08:33:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Current context notwithstanding, hope you make it to Shanghai soon. üòâ
1516695854484443137 2022-04-20 08:30:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BrexitMick Take note, anyone else who comes along with smart comments like Mick here. You will get exactly one before you're blocked, so make sure you choose it well. üòò
1516692938931458049 2022-04-20 08:19:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going forward, I probably won't be tweeting much about this much, unless the situation changes, or there's a funny meme.  I will return to my regularly-scheduled energy content, so if any of my new followers are interested, do stick around. Otherwise, thanks for dropping by. üëã
1516692907587424257 2022-04-20 08:19:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most districts are showing multi-day downtrend trends in community spread cases, which is great, but the numbers are still large overall, so while it seems we've turned a corner, it's also obvious that Shanghai has some ways to go as well. So now we just wait...
1516692904332656644 2022-04-20 08:19:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh, and we haven't nucleic-acid tested for 6 days now, which is great, because we're all convinced that this is the only way we were going to get infected anyway.  We all got a big bag of rapid antigen tests to use instead. So our protest and threatened mutiny worked, apparently.
1516692897676296194 2022-04-20 08:19:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Again by searching my sub-district and neighborhood on  https://t.co/yK5roMmR2m, I can see that many of the compounds nearby are gaining their freedom and being upgraded to Èò≤ËåÉÂå∫. I can see more people now riding bikes and walking out on the street. Weather has been so nice üò≥
1516692890453680130 2022-04-20 08:18:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And overall, data have been laggy to update, as I noted yesterday. Our case/mortality numbers reported right now are probably more reflective of what was going on 5-6 days ago, if I had to guess.   https://t.co/fcVXEkqkIZ
1516692885105946624 2022-04-20 08:18:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to online portals, the last positive case was cleared from our building on the 18th, so we're looking to our semi-freedom at the beginning of May, fingers crossed.  Of course the neighborhood committe confirms nothing and probably knows nothing, so we're guessing here.
1516692881578545155 2022-04-20 08:18:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As for medical, from that website it looks like need for covid-related and non covid-related medical help both are still pretty severe and transportation/treatment resources are struggling to keep up.  Our building has only had 2-3 cases though and we think we've cleared them.
1516692878126612481 2022-04-20 08:18:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have been tracking requests for food and medical aid at  https://t.co/LhQFmVFYnO and noticed that while food requests are STILL being sent out every day, from all over the city, the volume is way down compared to last week.  Now the effort is on helping the most vulnerable.
1516692872615325697 2022-04-20 08:18:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course we're still far from the old normal, when you could place a delivery order for AA batteries, or a single lemon, or a bottle of pineapple juice and expect it within 30 minutes, with minimal/no delivery charge. I think the delivery companies are still at 30-50% workforce.
1516692869108617216 2022-04-20 08:18:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The boss of an import food store about 50m from my compound told me last night that he was sneaking into the store to sell off some of his stock that he was afraid would expire.  I got cheese, crackers, butter, coconut milk, bourbon, rum, campari...all kinds of goodies.
1516692861886279681 2022-04-20 08:18:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To return to food: More shops are opening up now, with a variety of offers, some group buys, some even offering solo orders with a minimum spend.  The delivery logistics snarl at the local level appears to be really unwinding now, as the "new normal" settles into place.
1516692857138323456 2022-04-20 08:18:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, this has been wonderful for to meet my neighbors - most of whom I would never have any opportunity to talk to or get to know. The atmosphere is one of extreme mutual support. I know I have made friendships in the building that will persist beyond our lockdown.
1516692853388623873 2022-04-20 08:18:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *side note*  One of my neighbors told me a story about how becoming Secretary Yu isn't *that* great because it might make people recall Yu Zhengsheng ‰øûÊ≠£Â£∞, Shanghai Party boss from 2007-2012, who was widely considered to be sub-par for Shanghai's development. Ah well...
1516692847998939136 2022-04-20 08:18:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So while I've seen people on Twitter trying to make this into some kind of Lord of Flies allegory, I think it's not really apt.  Your stature and decision-making weight in the "building committee" is mostly determined by how much you have been willing &amp; able to do for others.
1516692844630917123 2022-04-20 08:18:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I found it notable that the response of my neighbors to someone volunteering their time and energy is to (jokingly) elevate them to Party secretary.  And also notable that people most able to give of themselves to others (our volunteer squad) defaulted into the leadership role.
1516692840755400712 2022-04-20 08:18:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm only half-joking about the last statement. Since my first group buy, about half the building (especially the elderly) started calling me ‰Ωô‰π¶ËÆ∞, or Secretary Yu (my CHN surname is Yu), which is a lighthearted nickname, but which I still find very flattering and humbling.
1516692836988911617 2022-04-20 08:18:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am not alone leading the group buys; we organized a kind of "building committee" comprised of our group buy leaders and volunteer squad. It's time/energy-intensive to do group buys so we share the responsibility.  We are effectively the newest, lowest rung of government (lol)
1516692833495060480 2022-04-20 08:18:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If we were relying on just the local committee to deliver our food, we might have been in a much more precarious state, but we organized early, quickly and effectively to place group buys and cover our needs.  This has honestly been a wonderful local Chinese civics lesson for me.
1516692817716068353 2022-04-20 08:18:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First topic: Food.  We have no food insecurity in our compound, nor have we for about 10 days. Between the infrequent and haphazard deliveriess from the local committee and the (far more consistent) group buys organized by the residents, we're doing just fine.
1516692814306091013 2022-04-20 08:18:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Time for a general updateüßµon what's going on in Shanghai. This will probably be my last one, since my personal situation has largely stabilized and I don't have personal experience from the rest of the city to try to tell you what's going on.  Today is Day 19 of lockdown for me.
1516668204441300993 2022-04-20 06:40:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cyril_ip @Jingjing_Li Many such cases:    https://t.co/DMal3pyxhk
1516668007237693447 2022-04-20 06:40:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jingjing_Li Stephen is *very* sensitive about criticism of his mediocre Chinese, because he clearly thinks it's pretty good. He blocked me when he thought I was talking about it.  Funny... when I said this, I guess I WAS talking about him and didn't even know it:   https://t.co/W8z5Rbi08D
1516658753390931970 2022-04-20 06:03:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @pajolicoe @crushspread Have you seen the site at  https://t.co/yK5roMmR2m ? I've heard there's a volunteer group trying to respond to the food and medical aid requests on that page. I'd try to get involved there, if I were allowed out...
1516349694502670337 2022-04-19 09:35:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattwaters86 @ASPI_watcher No idea about the infection data. The requests for aid on that site are pretty awful though. I know at least one volunteer group is monitoring this site and trying to respond to requests in real time. If I was able to leave, that's what I'd be doing.
1516302691634675712 2022-04-19 06:28:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AidenHeung @gabewildau The point Gabe is criticising is that Gao called it a "Potemkin village", not that people online were upset about it.  Potemkin village is a specific term with a specific meaning. Gao either fabricated this part of the story himself or shared misinformation uncriticially.
1516265662649597953 2022-04-19 04:01:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Along with this lag in reporting cases has undoubtedly also been a lag in reporting mortality numbers, which appear to be now coming out as well:   https://t.co/vIymxbKMTp
1516264685540356096 2022-04-19 03:57:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Today, for the first time (the 19th) our positive case that was removed from the building on the 13th showed up on the official ledger of Jing'an cases. This means two things:  1. At least a 6-day lag for the case report to go through the system.  2. Our 14 days start now.üòµ‚Äçüí´
1516118999343726593 2022-04-18 18:18:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ElijahSchaffer Pretty sure you were an object of pity more than anything else.
1516111078648066049 2022-04-18 17:47:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dali_Yang Just a small anecdote, of course, but one I thought was an interesting perspective. Neighbors are all old-school Shanghainese naturally.
1516110857864122368 2022-04-18 17:46:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dali_Yang Funny - was discussing Sun's visit with some neighbors tonight. The attitude was that they would prefer top leaders like Sun *not* visit SH anymore, because when top leaders come, the SH gov't switches their focus over to sucking up and showing off, instead of working hard.
1516109234114797569 2022-04-18 17:39:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Professor Henry Gao, QRT'ed here, has been a consistent repeat offender of misinfo, bad-faith interpretations, and salacious half-truths about the SH lockdown.  I've grown increasingly frustrated by his clickbaity antics over last few weeks and I'm glad others are seeing it too.
1516107044369346560 2022-04-18 17:31:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RHKFather2 @robindbrant So while OP was misusing the phrase "fully vaccinated", no doubt, it is indeed true and relevant that less than 40% of the elderly in Shanghai have had an *optimally efficacious dose* of the vaccines they have available to them.  And it's been available to them for ages...
1516104358764888064 2022-04-18 17:20:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RHKFather2 @robindbrant I think we've all seen the same data from HK.  After two doses, BNT gets a score of B and then moves up to an A with three doses.  After two doses, Coronavac gets a D or C, or then moves up to a very slightly higher A with three doses.   https://t.co/fsjr8OMqte
1515990752530419713 2022-04-18 09:48:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @james_clavell Haven't tested for a few days. Went for a walk earlier to get my delivery, thanks.  People who spend their time ranting at state media on Twitter are so mysterious to me. Is it therapeutic for you or something? Have you tried like...yoga or something? Like come on lol.
1515986885239517184 2022-04-18 09:33:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @james_clavell @SixthTone @JaredTNelson  https://t.co/Jjg0bMKtAv
1515929786887307264 2022-04-18 05:46:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MuadiWeiqi They did the previous day. But it was a new testing crew and:  1. They were wearing blue surgical gowns, not bunny suits 2. They weren't disinfecting and switching gloves between each door. 3. They tested a floor that had a suspected case before testing the rest of the building.
1515929267510837251 2022-04-18 05:44:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @robindbrant Think most are aware HK data indicate Sinovac needs the 3rd booster to achieve similar efficacy for the elderly as 2 shots of other vaccines.  But...the meaning of "fully vaxxed" has been used to refer to "two shots" everywhere else, so this tweet lacks precision.
1515924859976826886 2022-04-18 05:27:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Spare a moment of appreciation for these guys.  It's now abundantly clear what happens to the usually highly efficient delivery logistics machine when they are unable or unavailable to work.  Sad to see hotels refusing them - seems like something that could have been foreseen...
1515899086524018688 2022-04-18 03:44:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JoshC0301 I also think diff. municipal/district/local officials could be motivated BOTH to under-report, or to be *extremely* honest/accurate, depending on what the real situation is, their relationship with their superiors, what they judge to be helpful/harmful for their career dev., etc.
1515897746355781632 2022-04-18 03:39:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JoshC0301 Right now still too early to assume whether the data are incongrous due to intentionality or just normal processing lag.  I'll reserve my assessment for when the data are finalized and we can compare to the numbers from other places that also went through omicron.
1515894172812967937 2022-04-18 03:25:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JoshC0301 Well, we were at the point where it statistically beggared disbelief.  I think there's quite a reporting lag right now - similar to what we saw in Wuhan when 1000s of cases were belatedly added to the case total. We've had cases in our compound not yet appear in the daily sums.
1515576585411170304 2022-04-17 06:23:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wtruszczynska @EP_Lawrence There's like 20 compounds in all of Jing'an that are open right now - are you one of them?  You can make some good money picking up vegetables and running errands between compounds üòâ
1515573926688174082 2022-04-17 06:12:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence Well I see regular people shopping and I see people in bunny suits shopping also (ostensibly sourcing for their compounds) so I suppose it *could* be a recent photo from....somewhere in Shanghai. But it's definitely a bizarre/non-representative view of SH right now.
1515550813208424451 2022-04-17 04:40:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @ClaireMSheridan @RealSexyCyborg @crushspread I honestly don't know how to say anything in feet anymore...lol  In SZ a small 2BR 1LR was 65sqm. A "normal" 2BR like what I had was 80-90sqm. A large/luxury 2BR would be like 110sqm.  Shanghai on the other hand has a lot of old construction that is quite non-standardized...
1515510019680534528 2022-04-17 01:58:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @RealSexyCyborg @crushspread It's tempting to look to HVAC and other shared ventilation systems and maybe that is a vector, but I still won't count out old fashioned bad transmission control...the basics.
1515509485737246720 2022-04-17 01:56:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @RealSexyCyborg @crushspread Protocols for preventing spread have been atrocious in our building.  You can't keep the aunties from chatting without masks. You can't stop the uncles from smoking in the elevator hall. Yesterday we had volunteer testers who appeared to be first day on the job...no sanitizer.
1515304989169971204 2022-04-16 12:23:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Like come on basic media literacy pleeeeaaase??   It happened once in a video that's been posted to Weibo =/= it's happening everywhere in Shanghai/it's mainstream/it's representative/it's a growing trend.
1515301754241699840 2022-04-16 12:11:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @goldencaskcap Just trying to do my part keeping the pipes flowing smoothly
1515300492624408585 2022-04-16 12:06:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HohoChan657 There was a hyperbolic video clip montage thread "OMG THINGS ARE SO BAD IN SH RIGHT NOW" compiling individual bad things that happened somewhere in this city of 25M people over the last week.  One of them was a compound that advised its residents to eat less so they poop less.
1514998270682341376 2022-04-15 16:05:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yuanyi_z Don't worry though, he's an expert. üßê
1514960192718643210 2022-04-15 13:33:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @energybants I know what I would have done  https://t.co/deRBaPNGOh
1514923452263956482 2022-04-15 11:07:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay I got a good laugh from this one.  https://t.co/XQ3P8c5He5
1514918448199245826 2022-04-15 10:47:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence Have seen this a few times in the last few days. I bet this is that warm weather we had a few days ago coming back to bite us...thankfully it seems our next one is rice and oil.
1514874125172748288 2022-04-15 07:51:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Seriously the realest grindset culture there is. I'd read a business strategy book written by a hustler Shanghai vegetable seller over some Western tech CEO any day.
1514873631935205377 2022-04-15 07:49:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not just this.  Go on Meituan Delivery right now and select just about ANY vendor...it doesn't matter which. Coffee shop, crayfish restaurant, korean food...they've ALL transformed into wholesale grocery vendors selling bulk fruit, veg, and meat. Minimum orders still apply tho.
1514857792431325184 2022-04-15 06:46:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realmemes6 So I would assume white collar types are still working from home and the rest are hoping their companies are large enough to keep paying their wages, but without official policy guidance to my knowledge.  Requirements for delivery drivers are just that you test negative I think.
1514857248878915587 2022-04-15 06:44:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realmemes6 Yeah group buying is filling in the gaps for most people now at this point - with gaps in the the coverage still of course.  Those able to work from home are still working normally. Back in 2020 Shenzhen had policies for employers to guarantee wages, but I haven't seen that here.
1514849824826605576 2022-04-15 06:15:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu It's very smart satire. Because although this specific person isn't real, there are very real versions of this person in the United States, make no doubt.
1514848503742500870 2022-04-15 06:10:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AidenHeung The fixation on including mostly fresh food in the gov't Áâ©ËµÑ is predictable and understandable but obviously not the most optimized solution for sure.
1514847818393227266 2022-04-15 06:07:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign Hmm. Well with a population of this size, how far is 440k outside of a single standard deviation? How anomalous exactly are the data we're seeking an explanation for? (not gish galloping here. actually curious)
1514846600627392518 2022-04-15 06:02:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign Think you were alluding to this in the other thead, from a different angle. Among China's most low-income/vulnerable populations, sluggish macroecon performance could trickle down to loss of access to medical care, or insufficient calories? That's where I'd probably look first.
1514845474267996164 2022-04-15 05:58:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign Sorry looked at it too quickly. 500K. Or rather 440K  Which still implies ~25M infections that were successfully covered up, using typical mortality rates? Really hard to imagine.  My instinct is to look to impact of 2020 economic downturn on the vulnerable/food insecure.
1514843514806632448 2022-04-15 05:50:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign I don't know, I'm not biostatistician or epidemiologist. If the 5M excess mortality is an unimpeacable figure, then I'd be happy to hear any ideas that don't involve mass conspiracy on an literally impossible scale. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1514842603908636673 2022-04-15 05:46:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign Wow the scale of this conspiracy keeps growing.  Now we have excess deaths all over the country, implying many outbreaks with hundreds of millions of infected people in thousands of locales leading to 5 million dead. And no one heard a thing.
1514841936372572160 2022-04-15 05:43:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign *mass concealmemnt with perfect concealment at a mind-boggling scale but ALSO incompetent enough to somehow forget to doctor the reported data so that 5M excess mortality is readily visible to conspiracy theorists.*
1514841580091604996 2022-04-15 05:42:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kellyma_michael @RealSexyCyborg @pentney @jakubvlasek @whenipourireign Like c'mon man, SH has been a mess for just a few weeks and it's  impossible to keep it out of the news.  If the excess mortality figures are accurate, then you  look at most likely scenarios first. Mass conspiracy w/ perfect concealment on a mind-boggling scale is not one.

"Despite an entire country of internet users, including foreigners, China managed to conceal not just 5M covid deaths, but the 10s or 100s of millions of accompanying non-lethal infections implied as well".  ...is not the most likely explanation.
1514827660190687233 2022-04-15 04:47:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The video in question, which I also shared last night via @manyapan.  I still wonder if this really was the most reasonable option available, but it's good to have removed some of the ambiguity of the situation.   https://t.co/4NHmyRTq4K

1514804651761500163 2022-04-15 03:15:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AidenHeung Ew...Looks like the cucumbers and bok choy didn't make it. Potatoes, peppers, and garlic were probably (?) okay after a wash.
1514803244392148997 2022-04-15 03:10:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Li_Huajing lol isn't it like 20% group buy offers and 80% people bragging about what they just got üôÑ
1514797286077140995 2022-04-15 02:46:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's getting less convenient to find group buy offers online because all the search results are now full of media writing articles about group buying lol
1514795044573945858 2022-04-15 02:37:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yiqiquba1 A grocery store on Meituan. Mine was ÊûúÁúüÁîú.   Open up ÁæéÂõ¢Â§ñÂçñ and start opening up every vendor to see what they're offering. No one is delivering food; they've all switched to fruit and meat and vegetables. Even like, crayfish restaurants are selling vegetables now.
1514794647394320384 2022-04-15 02:36:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FForest26061365 I think everyone should used used to the idea that group buys will be the new grocery shopping for a bit.  Some vendors are now offering 10-15 items in the same bulk order,like a mini-grocery. Get your meat, veggies, milk, eggs, fruit, gloves, masks, bread all in once place.
1514652622426292224 2022-04-14 17:11:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 200kg of apples received and secured!  This is our last group buy for a few days, as we wait for our next round of tests following our first positive case.  https://t.co/4Hk7uJQNmM
1514637061537800197 2022-04-14 16:09:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I asked some of my OG shanghai neighbors and they said the property developer likely had unfinished buildings in the development &amp; signed a contract with the local gov't to house overflow quarantine demand, but residents of already-finished units nearby freaked. A theory. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1514613571157913602 2022-04-14 14:36:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Doesn't this city have literally thousands of empty hotels right now?  It seems like the most foreseeable reaction in the world, that the residents would be less than thrilled with their new neighbors...
1514608809968566272 2022-04-14 14:17:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wilstreak Oof.  https://t.co/uyhjvbO6z8

1514545313658589186 2022-04-14 10:05:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JaredTNelson @EP_Lawrence omg yours is so much more controversial!
1514543378972950528 2022-04-14 09:57:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @EP_Lawrence Suddenly feel like I don't know Shanghai very well...

1514540268653260807 2022-04-14 09:45:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yoko_not If you are having trouble getting food in Shanghai, please message me and I'll how I can help. My DMs are open.
1514538493409886209 2022-04-14 09:38:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @casperj33081634 Then he could say "I can't believe Shanghai's irresponsible and unreasonable pandemic response has resulted in food insecurity". I'd agree.  I don't have to tolerate some smug academic asshole in Singapore playing actual hunger games on Twitter because he craves clicks.

1514513940474372099 2022-04-14 08:00:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @henrysgao Hi from Shanghai.  The answer is probably Mariupol. This is a pretty gross question in general though. Maybe you should delete it.
1514482991137161219 2022-04-14 05:57:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DerNiederbayer Yeah I don't get that either. Common knowledge on masks hasn't updated in 2 years. I'd bet 75% of people wearing surgical masks right now think it's for their own protection from airborne infection (and not to catch their own droplets).
1514481547596136449 2022-04-14 05:51:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DerNiederbayer I dunno I personally think the risk is low but people are freaking out. We also have shared HVAC in the building and older plumbing so people are putting plastic wrap over their range hoods and plastic bags of water over the shower drain. Just general messiness.
1514481178879074304 2022-04-14 05:50:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DerNiederbayer It was the staging ground yesterday for a juweihui volunteer group to assemble a package of rapid antigen tests and some tcm medicine. A group of 10 old ladies with nothing but surgical masks and no gloves chatting and touching everything while they threw tests into bags.
1514475360695758849 2022-04-14 05:27:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Another hot topic is the fact that Â±ÖÂßî‰ºö has not yet properly sanitized the elevators and lobby after moving our positive case, so no one is willing to go outside.  I'm supposed to receive a group order of apples today. I'm going to wear a bunny suit if I can get one.

1514436479816433664 2022-04-14 02:52:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RnaudBertrand How are you guys keeping group buys organized?  Here's what we've been using. Really reduces the repetitive chatter in the groups with people re-asking the same questions "when will it arrive? Have we already placed the order?" etc.  https://t.co/eWPUQtqxqN
1514435779468357634 2022-04-14 02:50:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RnaudBertrand Bummer.  I made a GANNT chart for our building to plan all of our needed food deliveries out to the 26th, hoping that I wouldn't have to actually use it. Looking more likely that I actually will...and even need to extend it.
1514433982792101890 2022-04-14 02:42:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hot topic in our group chat today:   Our positive patient was confirmed on the evening of April 10 but wasn't removed from the building until April 13. Today is the 14th and we have a new round of tests today.  Assuming we're negative, is today Day 1 of our 7+7? Or Day 0? Day 4?
1514325500197765120 2022-04-13 19:31:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HardcoreIslands @SamRamani2 And today, dear reader, was the day that Twitter user lustinanus realized that actually it's neither easy to move factories in, nor out.   Because the real world is not a video game where you click and drag.
1514308181417426945 2022-04-13 18:22:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joshsteimle This is legitimately one of the dumbest false things I've ever heard someone claim about China, and I've heard quite a few.
1514250773374599173 2022-04-13 14:34:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @manyapan This video is about a week old at this point - by the time it started circulating, it was already impossible to get vegetables in this way anymore. The shopping cart checkout button couldn't refresh quickly enough and it would seize up. üòÖ
1514224342712086533 2022-04-13 12:49:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They found a hospital for her!  It took nearly a day of the pooled resources of the whole building to find something.  Someone even had their friend with 440k followers on Weibo (which seems like a lot but not really for China) to post the medical request.
1514204418946002957 2022-04-13 11:30:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chinahelpdesk Her son is freaking out in our our wechat group - he lives in a different part of town.  They're talking now about just calling the ambulance and bringing her directly to the hospital and forcing them to take her this way. This was a suggestion from someone at the hospital.
1514202000564822024 2022-04-13 11:21:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chinahelpdesk Over 90, so very much yes.
1514200550027710466 2022-04-13 11:15:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jdylan91 Not sure. Maybe it started as light symptoms and she declined to go to fangcang because of the poor conditions there?  Have you seen the videos of that place from today? The roof is leaking everywhere.
1514196208423936005 2022-04-13 10:58:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi Unvaccinated - over 90 as well.  Data out of HK show fair results for 2 doses of the Chinese vaccine and very good results for 3 doses in terms of preventing severe illness and mortality.  But as far as I understand, SH has a big problem with unvaccinated elderly.
1514195450735525888 2022-04-13 10:55:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With the food distribution problems we had a clear problem but also a clear path to a resolution. There was a goal to chase down and hard work could do it.  OTOH dealing with SH's seemingly overwhelmed healthcare system just makes you feel helpless. There's nothing anyone can do.
1514192253505650692 2022-04-13 10:42:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She's not doing well now, with severe symptoms. The local committee and sub-district have all signed off on moving her to a hospital, and an ambulance is ready, but there are no beds available anywhere.  Our building group has been looking all day with no success.
1514141964815732736 2022-04-13 07:22:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AndyBxxx @yangliuxh @ZichenWanghere @Jingjing_Li Thanks for the extra details.  Man...talk about unforced errors haha

The negative feedback from the Chinese public was so extreme and the punishments were made so severe that it seems very unlikely you'd find it today, except in very rare cases. Enjoy your street food.
1514135804876292099 2022-04-13 06:58:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @link85603270 @lsjngs @chenweihua Not the least of which because the penalties for using or manufacturing it are very, very harsh, including even the death penalty:    https://t.co/JvUi0vDFyZ  There was a story from back in 2013 about a man who got life in prison for producing gutter oil:    https://t.co/YTriJqj3vi
1514135337282736130 2022-04-13 06:56:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @link85603270 @lsjngs @chenweihua I think you mean recycled oil from restaurants? Despite the name, Âú∞Ê≤üÊ≤π or gutter oil is not collected from sewers/gutters and is not legal for consumption. Back in 2011-2012 there was a big crackdown against vendors using it illegally. I'd imagine it to be very, rare now.
1514101084431982596 2022-04-13 04:40:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lsjngs @chenweihua This is breakfast for *anyone* on the streets of China. But yes it's very affordable.

1513966145745088512 2022-04-12 19:43:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, you get the picture. Seems the cancellation was prudent. Better late than never.
1513965210755022851 2022-04-12 19:40:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I'm fucking speechless, do government leaders have shit in their brains?! In one day we have 20k cases, what are you celebrating with a gala?"  Then there's a reference to a Tang poem where soldiers fight a bloody battle while the generals have fun drinking with prostitutes.  https://t.co/2sRIyRvrIC
1513962614661201921 2022-04-12 19:29:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "I won't curse...there's no point. I'm just waiting for the entire Shanghai government to be fired and never find work again".  https://t.co/VvKPHzjiC1
1513961795572371456 2022-04-12 19:26:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Examples of some of the feedback it had been getting:   "Can you just hold back your desire for freedom, shut your mouth, and not sing? If those stars are really bored and want to help us fight the pandemic, then give them travel permits and have them deliver vegetables."  https://t.co/gxXBag6TJH
1513958817369047041 2022-04-12 19:14:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Would be curious if any insights from Chinese media are possible on how this even happened/if you were aware what was going on here? @yangliuxh @ZichenWanghere @Jingjing_Li @AndyBxxx
1513958814974115841 2022-04-12 19:14:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just seems like SH gov't/Dragon TV really lost the plot here. This backlash to an extremely poorly-conceived/timed event was very predictable.  Perhaps it was planned back when they really thought the lockdowns would be just 4 days? And this would be some kind of victory lap?
1513958811878719489 2022-04-12 19:14:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This announcement came at 1:30AM local time, just 90 minutes ago. I saw a few Weibo users post the Will Smith meme (Shanghai gov't is slapping Dragon TV) and guessed it was canceled.  But this obviously would have been planned w/ support and approval from SH gov't previously, so.  https://t.co/fQwE73Ao8W
1513958794807881737 2022-04-12 19:14:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shanghai's Dragon Television was planning to host an "Anti-Pandemic Special Gala" tomorrow night.  It has now thankfully been canceled, after a deluge of negative feedback from LITERALLY EVERYONE about how tacky it is to put on a star-studded TV special during a food crisis.  https://t.co/GYefmzrBKY
1513905171465932802 2022-04-12 15:41:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Eh wait, I've just noticed there's a whole chicken in there too! And twice as much meat as I calculated from the picture.  That would bring the "normal times" value up above 300 RMB.  So group buying is really not *that* more more expensive in this case. Maybe 20-30%.
1513903708727177220 2022-04-12 15:35:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's what some things from that shopping cart would cost during normal times (prices from Jingdong and Taobao with location set to other cities).  ~200 RMB for this stuff pictured...Add another 20-30RMB for the vegetables.   So group buying is about 2x more than usual.  https://t.co/HO0La4Wwvm
1513902652849274885 2022-04-12 15:31:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If purchasing through a group buy, at current "normal" prices it would be:  Vegetable + meat combo: 188 RMB 6 kg crate of oranges: 100 RMB 30 eggs: 60 RMB Box of Guangming Dairy milk: 60 RMB  Total: ~400 for the food, with shipping included (but likely minimum 30px requirement).
1513902644464852993 2022-04-12 15:31:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One extreme case from Weibo tonight that was shared around on Wechat too...  This person paid 888 RMB to deliver this package of food to their friend in Shanghai, with a 700 RMB delivery fee!  I don't know where this is, but these prices are on the VERY far end of the bell curve.  https://t.co/Dcp3GIXkVs
1513902493289566208 2022-04-12 15:30:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is still one of the only channels of food delivery available for people who are unable to use group buying because their compound doesn't allow it, or because they don't have enough people to meet the minimum order requirements.  Some use it to send food to their friends.
1513902489820893187 2022-04-12 15:30:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This Yicai article profiles a Shunfeng delivery driver who made over 10,000 RMB(!) in a single day(!) on 4.9, on the back of 60 orders.  Over 75% of his income that day came from tips, particularly from corporate deliveries, which have no tip limit.   https://t.co/Pqccz6HGD3  https://t.co/McoyyIflFi

Earning, on average *at least* 150 RMB/order, putting in a 12 hour workday with 2 orders/hour, they're making ~3600 RMB/day.  That's a month's wages in 2 days.
1513832617833299971 2022-04-12 10:53:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GDTVhazza @SeanUM_China It automatically refunds when you return the charger, minus whatever your usage charge was.
1513824030398500866 2022-04-12 10:19:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He was absolutely not allowed to enter until his test cleared. Fortunately he was only delayed a few hours, and not a day or something like that, or else we would have had a lot of spoilage.  (That's why were unloading the truck at midnight the other night).
1513823602843750408 2022-04-12 10:17:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Two nights ago, our big delivery was stuck at a highway checkpoint outside of SH for 4 hours because the driver's covid tests results from the day hadn't come out yet.  He only had a refrigerated truck (not a freezer) so our frozen pork partially defrosted but still stayed cool.
1513821567931023360 2022-04-12 10:09:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GDTVhazza @SeanUM_China Meituan has always worked for me if I pay the 99 RMB deposit fee.  But the option to pay the deposit will not be selectable until you click the "deposit free rental" button at least once and been informed that you can't....whereupon the "rent with deposit" button appears.

1513730937066258432 2022-04-12 04:09:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samshanghai I believe at least one online liquor store in Shanghai is still doing orders, but they're individual deliveries (at a minimum value threshhold), not bulk orders, so that should be ok :)

1513728781797969924 2022-04-12 04:00:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh, and milk of course.  There are a few restaurants I know are now delivering wine and beer by themselves or using a courier service.  Personaly I would only use the ones that self-deliver, since I think the couriers have better things to do, like picking up pharmacy orders.
1513727089983488000 2022-04-12 03:53:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Bonan_Me There was a girl on the first floor of our building thaht was so fixated on buying soda while others were telling her that it was unreasonable and to please stop, that it turned into full-on fighting in the group, and ugly words were said.
1513726096797495297 2022-04-12 03:49:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nocitizens @ArthurAhbez @RnaudBertrand Yeah the building next to mine had a "singing party" a few nights ago too that turned into yelling out the windows like this.  Imagine if the video was shared with the caption "wow, yelling is a good way to let off steam!"  The video is the same; the poster defines the narrative.
1513724671086440450 2022-04-12 03:44:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> PSA: If you're in Shanghai right now, please, please, don't participate in, or ask your neighbors to participate in group buying for sodas or other liquids besides drinking water.  It's heavy, unncessary, and an unreasonable burden on your friendly neighborhood volunteer team.

1513544264420315141 2022-04-11 15:47:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @richbrubaker Considering the three-stage classification system stipulates that the perquisite for release from lockdown is zero cases in your building for 14 days, I'd say so.
1513515896249417729 2022-04-11 13:54:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chontang Hmm...that's a nice idea. I think there are use cases for such a service. Daily stuff like testing and food procurement should be fine, because it's SH and you usually have Eng-speaking neighbors.  But i've heard if you get sick, most medical and transport staff have no English.
1513506292291506179 2022-04-11 13:16:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pplsartofwar @SecondRingSZN well...they kind of nailed the role stereotypes, at least from what I've experienced lol

So no, I'm probably not as clueless.  Also...uhm...yikes? Hope you're wrapping it up for the gals on portland st. No vaccine for hep c y'know.  https://t.co/FAquZqyeZ4

1513472640056700931 2022-04-11 11:02:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima It's nice to see that the system is actually working as intended. Let's hope they can keep their case-free status intact, as we work to do the same.  I noticed Meituan SH is trying to hire super aggressively right now. I was wondering who their target is...maybe its these people.
1513472107048763392 2022-04-11 11:00:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JeffBoeker @RealSexyCyborg Nice! We were running really low until our apartment's group order bags arrived last night.   The contents of the government bag have been so wildly random.

1513462092573319168 2022-04-11 10:20:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Yep.  I grew up on a farm, where we canned and froze our own veggies and meat for consumption all winter. But I can see how someone having little/no experience eating food like that would find it dubious - buying from the store and preparing it yourself both.

1513451256194695168 2022-04-11 09:37:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Relatedly, I was thinking about doing a "lessons learned on preparing for a SH-style 2-3 week lockdown, potentially but hopefully not coming soon to a Chinese city near you".  Random things like how almost none of the vegetable boxes have garlic. üòÖ
1513442261274853380 2022-04-11 09:02:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CafeCalculus Yeah for people like me that locked down on 4.1, the most panicky period was probably about 4.4-4.7 when we couldn't get deliveries, the lockdown period was extended with no clarity on duration, supplies were running low.  For others, it's still going on and still bad.
1513433880023678977 2022-04-11 08:28:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China "Oh you're probably interested in what's happening in Shanghai, right? Thus, we've curated information for you from accounts in Japan, Finland, and Washington DC. Here you go!"   ...thanks Twitter üòò
1513429791097356290 2022-04-11 08:12:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @china_laborlaw That's great! I'm guessing we're well away from that, what with the confirmed positive case in the building this morning. We got so close... üòë
1513429144771907584 2022-04-11 08:10:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm *begging* you to stop relying on journalists and pundits whose main model for commentary on SH or China is posting a days-video grabbed from online and adding a facile "wow!" or "grim" or "look at this!"üëáüëá  They have absolutely nothing to say.
1513427812396707842 2022-04-11 08:04:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just so much ignorant, condescending, smug, dog-whistle BS, much of it from people I have blocked or muted on here, because I find them intolerable.  No wonder there's so much panic and uncertainty out there, if you guys are deluged with this on the daily.
1513427809439739906 2022-04-11 08:04:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I jumped over to an alt account to see what Twitter looks like right now without a curated feed and realized how bad the tsunami of misinformation about SH really is.  I didn't get a single Twitter-promoted tweet about Shanghai right now from someone IN Shanghai or even in China.
1513420112212426752 2022-04-11 07:34:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RichardHanania What?
1513406386616827905 2022-04-11 06:39:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's a lady from the neighborhood committee who keeps posting important voice messages about food pickups in Wechat exclusively in SH dialect and it's very annoying (and classic Shanghai).  It's like she's in denial that her precious building could have non-locals in it lol.
1513403977014349825 2022-04-11 06:30:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg I can't believe a guy with the username William B. Fuckley is tweeting in bad faith
1513397198939389958 2022-04-11 06:03:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @timbray Both of theese are only offering wine and beer, but I'm sure other vendors have spirits. If this goes on longer, I may have to restock bourbon myself :)
1513394298699534337 2022-04-11 05:51:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In a positive development, two Western restaurants in my area are offering delivery services again. Not cheap, but if you've been living on home cooking for three weeks, it might be the change of pace you need to lift your spirits.  Barbarian and Bites &amp; Brews:  https://t.co/4cCnPHwpEy
1513392755825070081 2022-04-11 05:45:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SergioSammarchi This has actually been a concern in our building too. The range hoods over our stovetops are obviously all connected (I can smell my neighbors downstairs making food every day in my kitchen). People were talking about covering it with plastic wrap.
1513392354887335937 2022-04-11 05:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang The vast majority of our cases are classified as asymptomatic, so I figured it's similar here. Hard to gauge whether letting it rip would be more disruptive/have created higher societal toll at this point, considering our current measures aren't stemming the rising caseload.
1513388441488486403 2022-04-11 05:28:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Confirmed positive case in the building now..our first one.  Supposed to be confined to our apartment now, although there's been no actual implementation to enforce. This means probably at least another 14 days. üòê  Hopefully receipt of group buys not affected. We'll see.
1513380930962227208 2022-04-11 04:58:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danwwang I think tech and grocery platforms responding by putting together packages that could be delivered with the reduced workforce available (and also calling up more drivers from other provinces/back from SH lockdown)
1513374552788967427 2022-04-11 04:33:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @maybeoclock @TanguyAdriaens1 @TheIllix @ChrisMattson11 No it's not. This is pure silliness to anyone who has ever lived outside of the USA. Including one of the many, MANY countries that have more expensive dining out than the US and don't have tipping, say Sweden or Switzerland.  You are confused indeed, but about the wrong thing.
1513365806490750978 2022-04-11 03:58:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Important:   Here's at least one group in Shanghai that is likely to have little or no access to the channels we've been using to get food (i.e. government support package and/or group buying). There are likely many more who slip through the cracks.   https://t.co/diFJi2kw3k
1513347624753004546 2022-04-11 02:46:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AndyXuelai Yes, I've written several times about how important it is to check on the elders in your building and help make purchases for them online. I think I've mentioned it in every thread in the last 4 days.  Some people are getting JD orders very quick, some are waiting longer.
1513254595212234752 2022-04-10 20:36:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lockdownlunatic Yes, basically.
1513253341182447616 2022-04-10 20:31:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @evgurova I automatically block anyone that uses that hashtag.
1513251633060540416 2022-04-10 20:24:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you see anyone still talking about "people are starving in SH," feel free to send them this video. Our food distribution channels are changing; this is how we do it now. Others are too.  Don't let them pass off four-day old videos as current. Don't tolerate misinformation.
1513250805234954240 2022-04-10 20:21:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Honestly, it feels a little bit after the fact, since so many of the normal channels for food buying have re-opened. You can get online groceries from Jingdong, Century Mart, Hema...they're all back now, some of them even with no volume requirements. Now we focus on Covid.
1513249848304185350 2022-04-10 20:17:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our big bulk group buy arrived tonight around midnight, three days after we placed the order.  With this, we should be set for at least a week. We still have more veggies, bread, milk, and eggs coming tomorrow through. Mighta overdone it...  I made a video:  https://t.co/nnfHNau0kr

1513152178818785286 2022-04-10 13:49:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wokeglobaltimes Yeah, need to keep the test conditions clean, just in case someone thinks they got the shigella (but actually didn't) gives themselves uncontrollable diarrhea via the power of the placebo effect.
1513125097712005120 2022-04-10 12:01:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @Xavier_Basora @davidhmarsh Chinese household power cost are quite low.  Both because urban Chinese consume about half as much power per capita as their Western peers, and because Chinese residential power tariffs are fixed at a low rate by policy (not cost-reflective of fuel).
1513110859496976387 2022-04-10 11:05:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the competency spectrum:  Xianxia Xincun Sub-district (in Changning District) has launched its own Group Buying store inside the Kuaituantuan mini-app along with a full summary of Group Buy deals for its residents.

1513075990049988610 2022-04-10 08:46:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Conclusion:   YES, it is a crackdown...  ...on any unscrupulous vendors who would want to take advantage of the unique situation to price gouge and rip people off.

1513075946307620864 2022-04-10 08:46:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Prices should be clearly marked and accurate.  Contents, price, and units must all be indicated.

1513012410650861572 2022-04-10 04:34:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I had my complaints about Shenzhen's neighborhood committees in the past, but at least they were professional and generally seemed interested in doing their jobs well.  I get the feeling these nepotistic dinosaurs in SH haven't been expected to actually DO anything for decades.

1513002948728864774 2022-04-10 03:56:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Earlier in the week I said our neighborhood committee was doing alright, not great. They're doing their best to lower their eval to "f*cking terrible".  No one knows what they're doing now, no one can reach them, none of the stuff they say happens on time, or at all.
1513001144880340992 2022-04-10 03:49:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most are not particularly afraid of getting infected, since there's general belief that symptoms are likely to be very mild.   But there is general consensus that you absolutely do not, not, NOT want to go to Fangcang quarantine center.
1513000549335310342 2022-04-10 03:46:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At 1AM they said to get ready for the next round of tests to start at 7:30AM.  It's now noon &amp; we've seen no sign of medical teams or testing.  Also no sign of the milk and vegetables they supposedly got for us 5 days ago. We've secured actual trucks of groceries since then.
1512999201625427968 2022-04-10 03:41:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Second bag of food from the subdistrict arrived at midnight. They were shouting in the Wechat group for volunteers to help unload.   Today is revealed we may have a case in the building &amp; they knew, but had us assemble and provided volunteers with no PPE. Cold fury in the group.  https://t.co/ArhmlrYgow

1512738774320836609 2022-04-09 10:26:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We did a survey of the building last night/today and found 6 elderly people who hadn't joined any group buys and who had been living for 8 days on meagre rations, because they didn't have WeChat. This is a real thing.  Also one hungry French guy (language barrier issues).
1512737612838371328 2022-04-09 10:22:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few people have reached out to me so far in DM about getting support for bolstering food supplies. That channel is still open if needed.  Also if you can, please try to check that everyone in your building is getting enough supplies and has access to what they need.
1512736496738275329 2022-04-09 10:17:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also...my bread arrived today &amp; we distributed!

1512733423429091332 2022-04-09 10:05:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have heard from 3 different sources that they were able to make individual orders on Jingdong today (not group buys!).  Also Epermarket has reopened some deliveries (high-end import grocery delivery targeting foreigners) and Alibaba's Hema is supposedly going to reopen tomorrow.

But the people making Shanghai misery montages for Twitter have nothing additive to offer - just recycling strife on social media for clicks.

1512525164130447364 2022-04-08 20:17:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In particular, don't let me see you making smug comments about food insecurity induced by bad policy in SH, if you happen to live in, say, the USA, where ~38M people are food insecure always.  Or, say, HK, where 1/5 children and 1/3 elders live in hunger.  You know who you are.
1512525161958117378 2022-04-08 20:17:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I hope and believe we'll have reached some new steady state equilibrium within a week or so, and the breathless and unhelpful "Shanghai is starving its citizens" narratives will go away.  I've seen enough schadenfreude-laced headlines and tweets to make me furious for a week.
1512525159454117892 2022-04-08 20:17:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm planning to spend the weekend making sure we've resolved all the food insecurity in our building, if there still is any, and then helping others in town who still need support or advice.  So feel free to DM me if you're having trouble navigating the system. I will help.
1512525157180801024 2022-04-08 20:17:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And speaking of the neighborhood committee, my statement from a few days ago is still true now. If you've got a supportive, cooperative one, it's EVERYTHING.  Ours turned out to be pretty passive when it came to organizing food buys. So we took over.  https://t.co/wrJnUkkiPU
1512525155184316419 2022-04-08 20:17:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> However, I know a not-insignificant # people went to bed hungry tonight, if they got onto group buying later, were too small, neighborhood committee wouldn't let them, they couldn't afford...  All you have to do is look on Weibo or Xiaohongshu to find unhappy hungry people in SH.
1512525152143441924 2022-04-08 20:17:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I expect that the food sourcing panic for most places with access to the group buys will have faded as we exit the weekend.  People in my building are already joking about doing group buys for non-essentials like beer and sweets. We got our essentials squared away early.
1512525150193070081 2022-04-08 20:17:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So the 4/5th was when we knew this lockdown wasn't going to be lifted on time and the scramble for food became real.  &amp; the 8/9th is when the major tech cos were able to start to execute their reaction, shore up their supply chains, cobble together drivers, etc. About 96 hours.
1512525148259495938 2022-04-08 20:17:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall though,  it felt like we turned a corner on the 8th in terms of availability of group buys, with all the tech platforms getting fully into the action.  Before that it was all very piecemeal, unknown vendors, friend-of-a-friend-who-knows-a-guy on Wechat type stuff.
1512525145239613440 2022-04-08 20:17:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Still highly noticeably out of the picture is Carrefour. They rolled out their Á§æÂå∫ÈõÜÂçïË¥≠ with great fanfare and a hundred press releases THREE days ago, but Carrefour is still closed now, I don't know anyone who used it, &amp; I can't even find it. Did it have bugs or something? üí©  https://t.co/i2voiySZ8t
1512525139065597952 2022-04-08 20:17:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pinduoduo was already offering group vegetable/meat buying on subsidiary Kuaituantuan (which was basically created for Wuhan in 2020).  But Pinduoduo itself just rolled out a bunch of self-branded group buys, targeting sauces, snacks, seasonings, and cleaning products:  https://t.co/eG8x8ernYo
1512525132803481602 2022-04-08 20:17:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Beyond Alibaba, we've also seen action from China's other big tech companies, on whom the food delivery and distribution system relies.  Jingdong Daojia will begin offering bulk group buys from Saturday morning. Dingdong Maicai recalled 500 workers and will reopen 30 stores.  https://t.co/ItSRGz3ghd

1512012897236680705 2022-04-07 10:22:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @briefnorris Fair enough. I've always associated it with buying regional speciality goods from far away, like tea from Yunnan or cantaloupe from Xinjiang, because that's how I'd used it before. Not so much...pork and cabbages.

1511979125162274816 2022-04-07 08:08:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Obviously all of this would have been avoided if there had been better planning at the municipal level, for more distribution and delivery strength, for longer periods of lockdowns.  We shouldn't HAVE to do this.  But now that we are, it's kind of fun.  And my fridge is full. üòé
1511979118438813698 2022-04-07 08:08:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course it's predicated on everyone being able to easily communicate in the Wechat groups to sign up and pay for Group Buys.  This doesn't work for the elderly in our building. They have to have neighbors who volunteer to check if they need to buy anything and sign them up.
1511979115150458885 2022-04-07 08:08:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Group Buying isn't going to work for everyone of course. You need a big group. We have 184 people in our apartment group, so we have decent buying power, and can easily satisfy most minimum volume requirements. This is impossible for smaller buildings.
1511979111799205888 2022-04-07 08:08:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'm joking of course. I'm not earning any margin from my neighbors. I'm just happy that we're amply-supplied with meat and veg via the group buy channels, since the original delivery channels are strained to the breaking point. I got NOTHING via Meituan this morning.
1511979108569595907 2022-04-07 08:08:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Give me a week and I'll be group buying for the building next to mine too. In two weeks, I'll be group buying for the whole block. üòâ  Then I'll hire my own drivers, negotiate better prices with my vendors, start earning margin on my transactions, develop an app with a nice UX...
1511979104551469066 2022-04-07 08:08:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Is this efficient? Of course not. This is why the goods cost more via group buying, and they take longer to arrive.  The previous distribution economy had already realized HIGH system efficiency. Now we're trying to hack together some barely functional ersatz version of that.
1511979101024063493 2022-04-07 08:08:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By shifting our consumption to "Group Buying" we are reforming a distributed supply network. Instead of  warehouses delivering to a neighborhood distribution node where delivery drivers take it the final mile, the entrance to my apartment building IS the final distribution node.
1511979095026188288 2022-04-07 08:08:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. A significant # of food supply chain workers are locked down at home. This includes both freight handling to receive food from outside the city and shipping it into the city, not to mention the "final mile" delivery drivers. This workforce is greatly reduced.
1511979091754635268 2022-04-07 08:08:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. All the consumption is at home. We used to consume at home AND in restaurants, buying through a dozen channels, which themslves had a dozen supply channels. Now everything is bottlenecked through a handful of designated grocery distributors like Meituan Delivery.
1511979081348583425 2022-04-07 08:07:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Basically, you go searching online and in groups, looking for distributors with food in the SH suburbs  There's tons of food in warehouses in Chongming and Songjiang and Jinxian. If you find it and make a large enough order, the distributor can run a truck down to the city.
1511979078127353861 2022-04-07 08:07:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the last 2 days, I've joined group buys for vegetables, beef, and milk. I've personally organized a group buy for bread and am currently navigating my largest one yet: a large bulk buy for pork. The bread came to nearly 900 USD. The pork will probably be double that.
1511979074625097731 2022-04-07 08:07:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So Group Buying has of course been around in China for a long time, including for food, but it usually only made sense for a handful of food items....exotic things that required bulk orders to make the shipping worthwhile, like Maine lobsters or Inner Mongolian Beef. Not staples.
1511979071198351363 2022-04-07 08:07:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So it's CRAZY that we have to do this, it's also incredibly fascinating from a supply chain/logistics/economics perspective.  We are in the process of re-inventing the food distribution network in Shanghai.  It's all based on the newly prevalent concept of Group-Buying. Nerdyüßµ

1511586728058171392 2022-04-06 06:08:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I use this shortcut typing a lot on my phone, but I tend to type the words out entirely on my computer.  Only other place I would use the shortcut typing is when selecting a song at KTV üòÇ
1511583973549670406 2022-04-06 05:57:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Ah yeah that's even faster. Actually, I believe if you type "xa", the pinyin program recognizes it as an impossible phoneme and adds the apostrophe automatically.
1511582048255102977 2022-04-06 05:50:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most pinyin input programs also let you use an apostrophe to indicate where you want to split the characters.  So if I'm trying to type the city Xi'an and type just "xian" I will first see ÂÖà, Á∫ø, Âí∏, Áé∞ etc. But if I type xi'an I get options for Ë•øÂÆâ or Ë•øÂ≤∏ immediately.  3/3
1511582045478473730 2022-04-06 05:50:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/2  So Jingan is specifically Jing An. Without the apostrophe, you might say Jin Gan instead.  Same thing for Â≤≠Êæ≥ Ling'Ao (and not Lin Gao).   Or the city of Ë•øÂÆâ Xi'an (and not Xian).  If there's no erroneous phoneme to disambiguate, the apostrophe is unncessary. 2/3
1511582041787494400 2022-04-06 05:50:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh. Random thing my non-Chinese speaking followers probably have noticed but not realized:   We put an apostrophe in the middle of some pinyin words like Jing'an to indicate how the word is pronounced...This is necessary to disambiguate when multiple readings are possible.  1/3

1511574195310055425 2022-04-06 05:19:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, many districts are showing positive trends. My district (Jing'an) had just a handful of cases yesterday.   But these small wins are obscured by the bigger, poor results from Pudong, Minhang, and Xuhui, all primarily suburban districts. What's going on out there guys?
1511574192315334656 2022-04-06 05:19:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Falling: Jiading, Baoshan, Jing'an, Putuo, Chongming, Fengxian, Yangpu, Changning, Jinshan.  The inflection point for most districts where case numbers are falling really sticks out: a few days ago (Puxi lockdown).  BUT e.g. Huangpu locked down at same time and is still rising...
1511574188926312452 2022-04-06 05:19:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shanghai district Covid data from yesterday. Tracking total positive cases (including asymptomatic) and the 14-day trend.  Case numbers still rising: Pudong (severely, worst outbreak overall), Minhang, Xuhui (2nd and 3rd worst), Huangpu, Hongkou, Qingpu (rising from lower base).  https://t.co/PouZ5bBi3Y

1510961376524906502 2022-04-04 12:43:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing It's a combination of the local level gov't officials and the volunteers they've brought on from each building to help with food distribution and stuff like that. They're very responsive. Our whole building is in a big wechat group together so they're easy to reach.
1510961065437593604 2022-04-04 12:42:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing Me too. Almost pathologically so. I never throw food away, even when it's expired.
1510955819986460674 2022-04-04 12:21:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing I was planning to use ÁæéÂõ¢Ë∑ëËÖø to send it to some friends who hadn't received any food at all yet. But as long as it's going somewhere useful and not being wasted, that's ok. Plus my friends finally got their rations yesterday.
1510955530281697282 2022-04-04 12:20:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JSchwabing I asked our neighborhood committee about and she said they were designated as surplus in case they were needed by larger families, or old people who needed multiple bags because they wouldn't be able buy online.  The next day they suddenly disappeared, so I hope they got used.

1510856265706389506 2022-04-04 05:46:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @J_A_Quent @AndyBxxx Mainstream Chinese language media is pretty much all feel-good "Shanghai jia you" stories about volunteers arriving from around the country.  Caixin is covering the problems quite harshly on Caixin Global (their English portal).  https://t.co/T0oEuwZW6o
1510845713735122946 2022-04-04 05:04:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is a good report from @AndyBxxx and worth a watch. Hits on many of the major issues in Shanghai's lockdown right now, concisely and neutrally.  Would be impressed to see a followup is possible re: Fangcang quarantine center and reports of parent/child separation.
1510830865701830658 2022-04-04 04:05:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AndyBxxx I think part of the joke is that that some other communities asked their residents to dress up to make a good showing for Shanghai for the doctors and volunteers from other provinces.
1510829080266309632 2022-04-04 03:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 As for recording...I don't know what the law in China is about secret recordings, whether it's one-party or two-party consent? I felt she challenged him about the recording briefly because she was startled when he told her, but then thought on it &amp; decided she didn't care.
1510827407091322881 2022-04-04 03:51:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 I think you're focusing too much on the character of the caller. Perhaps he really is a lousy guy, I dunno. But he is worried about his parents' health and frustrated with the extremely poor treatment they've received, which I emathize with. He's got every right to be upset.
1510826947890544644 2022-04-04 03:49:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 I regret QRTing that guy and not just posting my own commentary, because I agree he was exaggerating some things for twitter clicks.  But I don't agree with your assessment of the guy on the call being a troublemaker with shenanigans or something like that.
1510683093388382209 2022-04-03 18:18:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zeke_Cao @RealSexyCyborg @manyapan I've found that one to work just fine in China too (amusingly, where nothing has been signed for the purpose of paying a bill for like...a decade...)

1510347245115576320 2022-04-02 20:03:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JurassicDunk @RodericDay I don't think the West never even got to the point where it could efficiently mass test and simultaneously identify thousands of asymptomatic positive cases. Shanghai can, and has. Now it has to figure out what to do with them, in the context of the zero-covid policy.
1510340127075475456 2022-04-02 19:35:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay It doesn't look like SH is abandoning zero-covid right now, just implementing a poor version of it, and no one can quite figure out why.
1510336895100010496 2022-04-02 19:22:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhongguoxin88 @RodericDay If it's fabricated, I suppose we'll know soon. It sure would be an elaborate one.
1510332616138182656 2022-04-02 19:05:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay Well she didn't say anything about zero covid in the call. She agreed with the man's complaint that SH's system has not worked for his [asymptomatic] parents.   Good results from Shenzhen seem to show zero-covid is still a reasonable goal. But SH is using different approach...
1510330501940539397 2022-04-02 18:57:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay I only skimmed the summary before listening to the call. Looking back at...it's a fairly reasonable summary - jazzed up a bit for twitter clickability but really not much.   The call was pretty clear anyway. The SH CDC woman sounded exhausted and at her wits end.
1510328782909243394 2022-04-02 18:50:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Er, *mainland China, to be precise üôÉ
1510327583006949378 2022-04-02 18:45:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Related note: I think (or hope?) this should make it easier for some to believe that this is China's first real outbreak since Wuhan 2020.  This is what it looks like when things are actually going to shit. You can't cover it up. Stuff like this circulates around. People know.
1510324858064097280 2022-04-02 18:34:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One thing is apparent: Current SH leadership can likely kiss their political careers goodbye when this is all said and done. üôÑ
1510312216582815745 2022-04-02 17:44:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jaredtnelson Anyway, I'm gonna check with our property management tomorrow if these are really pure surplus.  If so, maybe I can get them redirected to friends of friends that aren't getting food deliveries. ÁæéÂõ¢Ë∑ëËÖø appears to be still receiving orders to deliver parcels locally.
1510310137059491841 2022-04-02 17:36:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jaredtnelson Oh you mean that basketball team from Massachusetts - the Boston Celtuce?
1510308880311808000 2022-04-02 17:31:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jaredtnelson Yeah actually I WOULD probably have to spend more time explaining what celtuce is than respond to jokes about "book choy".
1510295755499913221 2022-04-02 16:39:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @comradeTL I've now cornered the market on broccoli in my neighborhood, so they're about to become much more valuable. But still not as valuable as ÈùíËèú.   From now on, please call me the Broccoli Baron.

1510289060912590851 2022-04-02 16:12:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I just found at least 1000 kgs of unclaimed vegetables downstairs.  Potatoes, carrots, book choy, cabbages, onions, broccoli, radish, and celtuce. Around 15kg per bag.  https://t.co/5FD3gBeEKU
1510257585068584960 2022-04-02 14:07:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay I have severe vegetable envy now compared to the loot others have gotten:    https://t.co/7VTSfVDDyo
1510210909113032704 2022-04-02 11:01:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our complementary vegetable ration last night wasn't half bad, considering how hard it is to buy green leafy veg right now. We had extra so anyone could go grab more if they wanted.  https://t.co/V2axgQi3jc
1510206394150326274 2022-04-02 10:43:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That being, I wonder how many cases there actually are of elderly people in Shanghai living alone without children or family members?  There are always exceptions, but generally I'd expect it to be rare to have old folks totally alone. It's China after all.
1510205304218460161 2022-04-02 10:39:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course, this is unusable for the elderly who can't use smartphones.  Older people here often only buy groceries one day at a time, fresh every morning. So even with 1 week lockdown warning, they may not have stocked up at all and are 100% reliant on the neighborhood committee.
1510203704481583113 2022-04-02 10:33:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Vegetables are a little trickier. Hema appears to have plenty of stock but no drivers. Meituan vegetable delivery is still working fine and there are plenty of stores delivering veg, but prices all over the place. And green leafy vegetables are sold out most of the time.
1510203146836279300 2022-04-02 10:31:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meituan is still still delivering in my area...dunno what it's like elsewhere. I was able to get coffee delivered from the one (1) coffee shop still open.  Also just got a delivery of fruits...nothing special, just apples and oranges and lemons. Prices highish but not exorbitant.
1510202185422106625 2022-04-02 10:27:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our neighborhood committee is doing alright, but not great. They're communicative, but in WeChat, which I assume the elderly are missing unless they're also knocking on doors individually.  They also seemed ill-prepared for elderly folks without QR codes yesterday during testing.
1510201140587405318 2022-04-02 10:23:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shanghai lockdowns giving the local neighborhood committees a chance to really shine...or fall flat on their face.  Communications, veg delivery, organizing testing, everything goes through them now.  And it seems they've received not much guidance re: job execution.

I think it can be a pretty big deal.

1508668928478035968 2022-03-29 04:54:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Who is affected? Every major Chinese developer with renewable assets. Many of them are owed billions. Nearly all of them are publicly listed.  They depserately need this cash to continue building RE capacity at the frantic pace required to meet the 2025/2030 carbon goals.  End.
1508668925760147457 2022-03-29 04:54:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Even if this one-time payout happens, the fund will still be unable to keep up with its annual credits going forward of course.  We forecast that its income won't match its IOUs until sometime in the mid-2030s. But this one-time cash payment will be huge for developer cashflow.
1508668920613736448 2022-03-29 04:54:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The reasons vary, but the most common reason is that a project failed to connect 100% of its capacity before the cutoff deadline for its subsidy rate.  So if a 100MW project only build 40MW before the deadline, the eligible subsidy volume is not 100MW and not even 40MW, but 0MW.
1508668915274366976 2022-03-29 04:54:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am currently working on an intense M&amp;A project for a state-owned developer with over 100 wind and solar projects in China.  After conducting our own audit of their operating portfolio, we have concluded that at least 13% of their capacity is actually ineligible for subsidies.
1508668911092649984 2022-03-29 04:54:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Personally, I think it will be a bit less. As mentioned in @YanQinyq's thread, there is an inspection process.  During this inspection process, authorities will be seeking to filter out any projects that do not qualify for subsidies, for whatever reason. It's an audit.
1508668898811727877 2022-03-29 04:54:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That item was #15, "Other Governmental Funds". The budget in 2021 was 98B CNY, but this year has been increased to 459B CNY.  Analysts quickly surmised that this is the budget item that will be used to pay off the outstanding debts of the renewable subsidy fund.  https://t.co/dqLHgEaX9t

1508381741387780098 2022-03-28 09:53:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In particular, SH is catching flak from the rest of China who are Not Impressed with how we are (seemingly) flailing while SZ just absolutely killed it.  Definitely has at least a whiff of SH exceptionalism to it. Time will tell.  Anyway. I'm strapped in with bourbon to spare.ü•É
1508381739512901638 2022-03-28 09:53:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Despite the rapidly-growing case numbers, it seems the vast majority of them are asymptomatic. So maybe Shanghai's approach is some type of clever, logical response to the specific nature of this outbreak. Maybe. But court of public opinion is not leaning that way right now.
1508381736174223366 2022-03-28 09:53:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The main point of these 4 day lockdowns seems to be to minimize movement while 2 rounds of mass nucleic acid testing are conducted.  It's not the "circuit breaker" method that has been used previously. Seems Shanghai is trying to innovate. Maybe it's genius? Maybe it's shitÔºüüòê

1508381725147435011 2022-03-28 09:53:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But my experience thus far is just mine. I honestly don't even dare to say if I'm in the minority or majority.  Anyone representing individual singular experiences as something larger is perhaps being dishonest...
1508381722962198529 2022-03-28 09:53:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pudong started its 4-day widescale lockdown today, but things here in Puxi are the same as they were yesterday, except that some people are panic-buying vegetables now in anticipation of our 4 days coming on April 1, which is obviously annoying and disruptive.
1508381720873435144 2022-03-28 09:53:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's *my* experience so far:  My building hasn't ever locked down (false alarm earlier), and restaurants and coffee shops in my neighborhood are all still available for takeout and delivery (no dine-in).

1508381718512025605 2022-03-28 09:53:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Lot of wild misinfo circulating about SH now.

For example subsidized wind/solar, or most nuclear and hydro.  If they trade in the open markets, then their settlement price was very comparable to whatever price coal-fired power is trading at.

The final destination, according to policy docs, is a "fairly liberalized" power sector.

1506098498076299271 2022-03-22 02:40:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qin_duke @gonglei89 We maintain in-house LCOE forecast models for China coal/solar/wind. Wind and solar costs are A. well understood, and B. competitive in many parts of China, without subsidies.  Nothing wrong with nuclear and hydro - they clearly have application cases also. It's not either/or.
1506095801344602115 2022-03-22 02:29:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qin_duke @gonglei89 So high power prices are unambiguously great for RE generators with already-existing assets.  But it gets more complicated if you're hoping to build a new RE project, since yes, you can look forward to higher revenue but your CAPEX also rises. ü•≤
1506094737656532992 2022-03-22 02:25:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qin_duke @gonglei89 LCOE of newbuild solar and wind in 2021 was actually quite competitive with coal-fired power and even cheaper in many provinces in China.  But things are weird now because the high power prices also drive up silicon and steel prices, which in turn drives up solar/wind LCOE.

1505856139623542784 2022-03-21 10:37:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As long as they don't have a fixed rate, these clean generators are all able to enjoy higher power offtake prices (which are linked to coal prices) in the wholesale markets, while themselves having very low marginal cost of generation (for wind/solar/hydro, it's essentially 0).

1505856128068259847 2022-03-21 10:37:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As for Huadian Energy (SHA:600726), it's been hammered two years in a row. 3B CNY in losses this year, 1.1B CNY losses last year.  The sister company Huadian Int'l has RE assets, but Huadian Energy itself is purely coal. Its holdings are also quite small overall.  https://t.co/Ct9rcpsaob
1505856123324465159 2022-03-21 10:37:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Huaneng as a company overall can look forward to covering about half of those losses from its strong (listed) hydropower business. Its renewables business also presumably did well last year (it delisted from HKSE in 2020).  Datang on the other hand only has a small RE business.
1505856118752673794 2022-03-21 10:37:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The biggest losers were Huaneng Int'l and Datang Power. They each ate about 10B CNY on their thermal power business last year (or ~1.6B USD).  You might not know from Huaneng's stock ticker (NYSE:HNP).  Datang's looks pretty much how you'd expect though (HKSE:0991).  https://t.co/RCsQ3fstOi

1505856108774461445 2022-03-21 10:37:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> One survivor: CR Power managed to eke a profit for the year, thanks to great performance from its clean energy business. Its thermal business posted 4.8B CNY loss(!) while its clean energy business had a 6.8B CNY profit (!!).  Clean energy makes up 31% of its installed capacity.  https://t.co/0tc4W3uG3Q

1504792153373167621 2022-03-18 12:09:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jrmygrdn Nice highlight of the new district heating program at Hongyanhe!  Not only is it good for the environment...it's also very good for CGN's finances. I did a little background thread:   https://t.co/inHrHpPtbU
1504788461307691014 2022-03-18 11:55:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I was always surprised that CGN was in any rush to build Hongyanhe 5-6, or that CNNC would be interested in building Xudapu 1-2.  If they are planning to provide district heating though, then their function to cleanly replace coal in the NE Grid becomes much more clear.  End.
1504788453040738305 2022-03-18 11:54:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So essentially you can see this as an example of "if you can't beat them, join them".  Due to the market conditions in NE China, this plant would probably have always struggled with low dispatch unless it retrofit to offer combined heat and power (CHP) services.
1504788449534287872 2022-03-18 11:54:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So why was Hongyanhe curtailed, though this is generally a bad thing for nuclear?  1. The Northeast Grid is heavily oversupplied with coal and wind.  2. Coal plants get priority dispatch in the winter months, because they are used for...drumroll please...  ...district heating!
1504788447038697472 2022-03-18 11:54:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China doesn't yet have a capacity power market (where generation assets are compensated just for being available, even if they aren't used), so for quite a few years, this plant has been struggling with low offtake, costing money to operate but not earning much.
1504788442856955904 2022-03-18 11:54:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It was a running industry joke at CGN  - if they complained that an outage at a plant was taking longer than usual, you could say "well at least it's not as bad as Hongyanhe" and everyone would kind of grimly laugh.  It was a rare economic stinker for the Chinese nuclear sector.
1504788435512733696 2022-03-18 11:54:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Additional backstory üßµon this nice thread from @jrmygrdn :  Hongyanhe NPP previously had some of the lowest load factors in China, especially Units 3 and 4 (see images).

1504088796740022272 2022-03-16 13:34:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A list of "target subdistricts" follows, e.g.   Jing'an District: Jiangning Rd, Pengpu, Daning, North Station...etc.  Looks like nearly every district in Shanghai has at least one sub-district with a rolling 48-hour lockdown coming.

Are they all going to pretend they never said any of this? Or will we just be back to "well they're probably lying about their numbers anyway"?

1503950122371092482 2022-03-16 04:23:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima Related - In the past year, Dianping started punishing restaurants that were gaming their review score with false reviews. If they were caught, their rating was suspended entirely for a period of time. Recently I saw the SH locally-famous ‰Ω≥ÂÆ∂Ê±§ÂåÖ had been busted.

1503819781681532928 2022-03-15 19:45:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zebraimage Oh offshore Fujian has good wind resources no doubt. I just wouldn't have guessed zhangzhou, but i guess it makes sense to keep it away from the larger cities like fuzhou or quanzhou that probably have more port traffic.
1503810273718648832 2022-03-15 19:08:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, the Zhangzhou madlads are hoping to get approval for their behemoth of a project by the end of 2022.  If this thing is actually built as-is, I'll be very surprised. I could see a scaled-down version of it being approved though. Or perhaps it'll be built in MANY phases?
1503809587962470404 2022-03-15 19:05:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have to be doubtful when I see insanely oversized superprojects in unlikely locations like this.

The Tibet grid was only recently connected to the rest of the country in 2018 I think - difficulties related to its size, remoteness, and elevation.  I honestly don't know too much about it. excecpt that it has its own special pricing rules and heavily subsidized power.

1503304064519483394 2022-03-14 09:36:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The three "key drivers" in the legend determine how and why you'd want to use energy storage:  1. Do you need energy instantly, in very precise volumes? 2. Do you need a way to offset the time between generating power and using power? 3. Can you avoid greater costs with storage?
1503302519144939525 2022-03-14 09:30:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not a hot take at all!

1503251256206258176 2022-03-14 06:06:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just one day later, the atmosphere has shifted. All the restaurants on my street are now takeout only - probably a good development.

1499588743459602434 2022-03-04 03:33:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Additional: Where are the potential risks in a worst-case scenario?  *Simultaneous* loss of offsite power and backup diesel generators (which is what happened in Fukushima) could result in failure of two backups at once, meaning the plant is on batteries.   https://t.co/pDkT1rdvS2
1499586819326824450 2022-03-04 03:25:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Please don't spread wild rumors. That includes Ukrainian media. The Ukrainian government has already been in touch with the IAEA to report the situation at the plant is ok.   Unless you have a better source than the UA government, you are likely spreading misinformation.   End.
1499586817418428418 2022-03-04 03:25:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nuclear reactors are overdesigned for scenarios precisely like this, believe it or not. The range of situations designers and regulators consider when licensing a plant is very broad.  So while the situation is awful, we don't have to add nuclear disaster to our worries.
1499586815413547012 2022-03-04 03:25:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In this scenario, I'd assume the reactor will shut down and switch to using offsite power (normally plants use their own power). The plant needs power to keep electronics and pumps for cooling water operating.  If offsite power is lost, it would switch to huge backup generators.
1499586813006004226 2022-03-04 03:25:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the IAEA has also recieved reports from Ukrainian authorities that NO increased levels of radiation have been detected around the plant. Great news.   https://t.co/X9xIuw2Kfp
1499586810665574405 2022-03-04 03:25:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From reports we're seen, the plant received munitions falling on the parking lot. This should have no impact on the safety facilities and equipment required to maintain plant coolability. The IAEA has already released a statement to this effect:   https://t.co/h7kF9ssJdk

The second sentence should read: "don't push [responsibility for] the rude comments that happen online onto foreigners [that shared the news of such behavior]" (brackets mine)  This logically flows way better into the next sentence.  h/t: @Silmarillion88
1498226180985536513 2022-02-28 09:18:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Final note: I condensed and simplified the translated comments in some places to make it fit into tweet character limits and things like that. If you think I really materially distorted the meaning of something by mistranslation, just let me know *politely*, please.  End.
1498226177688801281 2022-02-28 09:18:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And also I guess:   4. Surely this debate will continue, about whether/how/in what forums Chinese people should be ‚Äúairing China's dirty laundry‚Äù, in spaces both domestic and international, (e.g. Twitter) where they could be leveraged to China's detriment.
1498226175612633089 2022-02-28 09:18:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The things that struck me about this short exchange are:   1. Humanism won this round it seems. 2. Chinese netizen commentary is nearly always more nuanced than it gets credit for (varies by platform ofc).  3. Chinese netizens know Western journos mine their comments for quotes.
1498226172269785089 2022-02-28 09:18:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "...we don't have to be so noble, but nor should we be obscene, or hit someone while they're already down, spreading troubles to others. We must have our own bottom line for our conduct, or else what's the point of being human?"  This post received upvotes as well, although less.

1498226162903912450 2022-02-28 09:18:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I noted the mild descriptor for Russia that was used here: ÂèëËµ∑Êñπ, lit. "initiating party".  This slight rebuke became the most upvoted comment on the article and even inspired the sub-quoted commenter Â∞èÊñå to follow with an additional comment to clarify their position.

1498226148488015876 2022-02-28 09:18:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not sure if these comments were aimed at something that was said in the article itself, or at some other comments to the article (that were later removed maybe...? because I couldn't see anything here).

1498226146369957892 2022-02-28 09:18:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And also this comment, which got a decent number of upvotes:  "Netizen friends (should) take care to be more proper in their words (ÁïôÂè£Âæ∑).

You find KR people *living* here, not as temporary expats. There are young guys working retail and ajummas at the grocery store.
1497925294656614401 2022-02-27 13:23:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's esp. bustling at night, with a night market and lots of street vendors, plus long lines at restaurants.

Instead of sympathizing, you tried to hijack the discussion into a totally unrelated topic to complain about Chinese students.
1497052409796775939 2022-02-25 03:34:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Exactly. The structure the judeo-christian west offers as a paragon for leadership is a that of moralistic adventurous policing model. The Crusades, remixed. China is much less/basically not encumbered by such evangelistic tendencies.

1496692916521091075 2022-02-24 03:46:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pplsartofwar No one EVER advised us on what type of financial impossibility it is, to start repaying 800 or 1000 bucks a month on a first-year graduate salary at the age of 23. I am an extreme outlier, thanks to starting my career in China.
1496692004067053571 2022-02-24 03:42:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pplsartofwar Yeah at 50k a year tuition for top private schools (a decade ago) it wasn't rare to come out of your 4 year degree with 150k in loans.  My min. monthly payments were around $650 at the beginning, 250 of which was interest. If you've got 150k, your interest alone is at least 500.
1496690978438082560 2022-02-24 03:38:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IvanPMasli I had a basket of subsidized and unsubsidized loans, ranging between 3.5% and 6.5%. I think the weighted average was around 5.5%. I focused on the higher ones first of course.
1496690212994355205 2022-02-24 03:35:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I count myself very lucky overall. I emerged from my six years of BA+MA with "only" 83k USD in loans.  I was able to clear that in 6 years, with very aggressive repayment thanks to low cost of living in China.  Have friends with 150k+. They can't even touch the principal.

I think many of them would be highly interchangeble from the grid's perspective. So it's a luxury to be able to research them all at once to ID the best few.

1491676257624363011 2022-02-10 07:31:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BaysNet Laugh all you want about the thin skin that led to the original image being censored. There's some validity there. I personally think it was a silly thing to censor.  But that's not what you're doing. You unironically think Pooh is blanket banned and you're an moron for that.
1491675567883649025 2022-02-10 07:29:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BaysNet It's been what...8 years of repeating this myth? 8 years since a *single specific image* of Obama and Xi compared to Tigger and Pooh was decided by Chinese censors to be disrespectful and removed, having no effect on the rest of the Winnie the Pooh brand and merchandise.
1491674123721789440 2022-02-10 07:23:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BaysNet Funny, I'd think after seeing these pictures you'd realize your original understanding was wrong.  Like how much more evidence do you need? Fans on the street with Pooh dolls isn't enough? Pooh at Shanghai Disneyland isn't enough? Endless Pooh products on Taobao isn't enough?

1491505927765127168 2022-02-09 20:14:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango @Allieism_ Thanks Cadence.  @Allieism_  I intended for the comment about "sensitivity" to be the basis of the "false positive" metaphor. I didn't mean it in a gendered way at all - sorry it made you feel that.
1491494300600860672 2022-02-09 19:28:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Allieism_ I found it worth mentioning because we got in the elevator and my gf gasped and said "oh my god, look! already!" That's all. If you found it inane, then I dunno...sorry.  I'm not in the mood for a fight, which it seems you're really keen for, so have a good night.
1491491818524987392 2022-02-09 19:18:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> PSA: I thought the ad came out very quickly - impressively so, because I hadn't seen it before. Apparently it's actually been around for a while. Ok fine then. It's new to me and my elevator!   There is no other subtext here. If you were thinking about being weird - please don't.
1491489081418678276 2022-02-09 19:08:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Allieism_ I work in the electric power sector. It's not a reference to "soft power" or something jargony.  If you found my observations of my elevator ads offensive, all I say is I recommend lowering your sensitivity settings. You're getting false positives here.

1491080370661761027 2022-02-08 16:03:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bartvdpoel3 I wonder if the designers of nuclear power plants have to consider that when designing their 6 billion dollar  nuclear reactor with a 60+ year lifespan?  :)
1491055352636649472 2022-02-08 14:24:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Used to do some work with a major US manufacturer of HDPE piping for nuclear applications, helping promote their products in China. The industry was VERY interested in the advancements made in HDPE technology. It was like a miracle for the water chemistry engineers.
1491054735339638785 2022-02-08 14:22:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Older vintage plants used to have more issues with corrosion and scale buildup, but there are many mitigation measures. See here if curious:    https://t.co/eLCSg1gOs0  In recent years, many plants have begun swapping saline water systems with HDPE piping, which doesn't corrode.

1490867538607370241 2022-02-08 01:58:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Is the project likely to actually go ahead? I don't know...too hard.   What we found out today is that if it fails, then the reason wasn't because of the merits or weaknesses of the tech itself, and instead had more to do with project economics or (most likely) geopolitics.
1490867536111366144 2022-02-08 01:58:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If the HPR1000 is to be built in the UK, the location is Bradwell B in Essex. It is a joint investment project between China General Nuclear and EDF planned since 2016.  It is based on the same design for which China just signed a deal with Argentina:   https://t.co/VE37dhS5s1
1490867534236893192 2022-02-08 01:58:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Passing this final Phase means the design is approved and a Statement of Design Acceptability (SoDA) can be issued.  Passing the GDA does not mean a reactor will definitely be built. For instance, the AP1000 also passed its GDA and was not built.   https://t.co/5Po6ge4Coq
1490867531833217024 2022-02-08 01:58:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I've been following the GDA process for years and even worked before with some UK engineering firms that were hoping to get work consulting with CGN to get the HPR1000 design certified in the UK.  I've mentioned before how important this assessment is:   https://t.co/slV2Oc9F9j
1490867530105499648 2022-02-08 01:58:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The UK variant of the HPR1000 (aka Hualong One) has been going through the UK's GDA process since January 2017. it's a long process. You can see the 4 Phases that the project had to go through here on the Office of Nuclear Regulation's (ONR) website:   https://t.co/RE19gEDBBi
1490867526447734784 2022-02-08 01:58:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few people have sent this to me so I'll try to explain what it means.  Basically a design for a nuclear power plant has to be approved by the UK regulator before it can be built there. This is called the Generic Design Assessment, or GDA.

1490661398933688328 2022-02-07 12:19:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Cho965256 He held a cardboard box under the drilling area to catch the dust
1490631609229275136 2022-02-07 10:20:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He told me his install team has ~100 people doing his job. They cover four districts. Xiaomi has several work groups of this size in Shanghai to meet their install needs.   Quite a lot of economic activity being generated just via installation of Xiaomi IoT devices in Shanghai.
1490631606033285128 2022-02-07 10:20:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now of course his installs aren't all TV wall mounts. He told me he can install all Xiaomi's smart home devices... lighting, cameras, thermostats, fridges, etc. TV is probably a bigger item. But still very good money for shifu work, higher than Shanghai avg. monthly salary.
1490631603558633472 2022-02-07 10:20:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 60 is the cost of the wall bracket so 130 is the labor. The shifu gets 40% of that, so 52 RMB. He does this fulltime, making ~15 house visits per day.  If they're all TVs, then he's looking at 780 RMB/day, or over 17k a month (if he rests weekends...which he probably doesn't).
1490631597627899904 2022-02-07 10:20:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> David the Xiaomi shill part 4:  I bought a new TV and paid for the installation service. I'm pretty handy around the house but concrete drilling requires tools I don't have.  Everything is handled via Xiaomi's Taobao store. 190 RMB for the installation service (30 bucks).  https://t.co/ztQqDF6aKO

1490010054187094019 2022-02-05 17:10:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So these kinds of rhetorical questions are overall not very strong argumentation devices.  I am more familiar with the technology, and I would be happy to have a nuclear power plant in my back yard.  And that appears to also be a common view for those who literally do.
1490009410197856261 2022-02-05 17:08:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Surveys in the USA have consistently found that people in communities with nuclear power plants are significantly *more* likely to be supportive of nuclear power.

If they ever find a export customer for the CAP1400, that will be another story, as it is an expansion of the AP1000. But the only credible lead they had for CAP1400s (in Turkey) has fallen apart (and that lead also involved WEC AP1000s).

This ASPI page I found about sanctioned Chinese nuclear companies  is full of errors. üôÑMaybe I'll do a thread on it in the future. But for now:  1. CNPRI belongs to CGN, not CNNC. Wrong company. 2. The Chinese name of CNPRI is wrong. Basic stuff.   https://t.co/YpJeo0y2ke
1488811598655352833 2022-02-02 09:48:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few random things I discovered while putting together this thread:  1. Argentina's ambassador to China announced in Nov. that it will formally join the Belt and Road Initiative, and like...no one reported it except Chinese and some Argentine media. Kinda seems like a big deal?  https://t.co/cCEvJEO1UW
1488798007185137667 2022-02-02 08:54:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Addendum: USG export control entity list. Relevant CNNC subsidiaries on page 32:   https://t.co/c6YpajZKei
1488798001904582658 2022-02-02 08:54:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is such a big deal because it's the first proper nuclear export project China has secured, with its homegrown technology, to a customer who had options.  They've exported to Pakistan in the past, but Pakistan has no options, due to sanctions. This is different.
1488797998045745160 2022-02-02 08:54:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Keep in mind this deal has been negotiated for the better part of a deacde. The changing politics in Argentina made it very difficult to get a consistent thread of negotiation.  Many (reasonably) thought it was dead - see this SupChina article from 2020.  https://t.co/OaJtosK79t
1488797995390824450 2022-02-02 08:54:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For someone who has been in the Chinese energy sector my entire (admittedly not *that* long) career, I had started to think exporting Chinese nuclear tech was a pipe dream.  I've been lamely answering media questions about "will China export its nuclear technology?" since 2014.
1488797992593215494 2022-02-02 08:54:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The tech is the 1.2 GW Hualong One reactor already deployed in China at Fuqing and Fangchenggang. CNNC is the general contractor.  ICBC and BoC will finance 85% to the tune of 8B USD.  Argentina not technically a BRI member but plans to join this year:   https://t.co/iG1nEefbuq
1488797988252098561 2022-02-02 08:54:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Wow. Argentina has confirmed it will use Chinese Hualong One tech for its Atucha 3 nuclear reactor.  HUGE for the Chinese nuclear industry - securing an export deal has been the goal for as long as I've been covering the sector.

1487001871843663872 2022-01-28 09:57:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A policy that evaluates and punishes provinces and power consumers for using too much CARBON will have more targeted outcomes than targeting general energy consumption and intensity. The latter is a good start, but the former is better.

1486012383869169664 2022-01-25 16:25:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Vinncent Now I can't tell if your RTs on this post are supportive or ironic  https://t.co/nUJRbFRjal
1485910066008141826 2022-01-25 09:39:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Holy! Look at that spike!  It's most apparent in Dec, but if you look closely, Nov was elevated too.  Tempting to say it's the lure of high power prices in the wholesale market...but actually these projects should have been planned well before the Q4 power supply disruption.
1485907134030426114 2022-01-25 09:27:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 19/19  Well that's it...basically all the ways you can buy green power in China today.  We residential users don't have options yet - we have to take whatever is in the grid. In SH, that was 32% green in 2021 (mostly hydropower).  Thanks for reading! RT if you found it useful. üòÄ
1485907130943414273 2022-01-25 09:27:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 18/  Of course there are some special cases that I won't cover in depth.  For example Apple created a green power investment fund for its suppliers to join into.  Jiangsu Province is piloting a scheme where you can buy green power from your neighbor's roof.  Other stuff exists...
1485907128150011905 2022-01-25 09:27:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 17/ We don't advise our clients to consider China IRECs until the database is cleaned up and double-counted projects are removed. Otherwise the certificates really are junk and the company is engaging in greenwashing.  Before 2021, a lot of int'l. firms were using IRECs. Oops. üòú
1485907125377576962 2022-01-25 09:27:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16/ The topic of unbundled certificates in China is tricky. The lnternational Renewable Energy Certificate (IREC) body has basically admitted that most IRECs in China are total garbage, because the attributes have been counted twice.  They intend to re-launch China IRECs in 2023.
1485907122714193923 2022-01-25 09:27:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15/  As you can guess, unbundled certificates are  controversial to some people. How can you claim that you use green power when you didn't actually consume it yourself?  But if works, if you can demonstrate that the green power attributes were not claimed by anyone else...
1485907119614599172 2022-01-25 09:27:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14/ The final channel for green power procurement in China is an unbundled green certificate. Basically you pay for a paper with the concept of green power attributes, but you don't actually consume the power.  This allows you to claim green power generated thousands of km away.
1485907116418531329 2022-01-25 09:27:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13/ If you buy green power this way, you get a bundled Renewable Consumption Certificate (RCC). This certificate is proof that you bought and consumed green power. In China they are blockchain-verified.  If you're an Apple supplier, this is what Apple wants to see.  e.g.  https://t.co/Ag20ffYJ7x
1485907109007208449 2022-01-25 09:27:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/ This is a tricky business for a power retailer - to sign a multi-year contract to supply power at a fixed price, while being exposed to fluctuating prices in the markets to procure.  Most of China's largest power retailers are also generators. This helps reduce risk.
1485907106184462338 2022-01-25 09:27:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/ In the screenshot above, the supplier quoted a monthly premium for green power that met the customer's requirements of escalating up to 50% RE by 2025. The rest is regular "grid mix".  The supplier buys green power in bulk in the wholesale market and chops it up to sell.
1485907103005147137 2022-01-25 09:27:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/  What's far more common for "mere mortals" with 'normal' industrial power demand is that you'll ask your utility to quote you for power with a certain ratio of green energy.  Here's an example of what a quote looked like back in November 2021.  https://t.co/ORaYQKZc6i
1485907091974164480 2022-01-25 09:27:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/  A large user like BASF could also negotiate with a generator for green power supply for already-existing facilities, like it did in Jiangsu last year. CGN New Energy was the power provider in this case. Again, the supply volume was *very* large.   https://t.co/GLtZw713zT
1485907087679168515 2022-01-25 09:27:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/  The German chemicals company BASF made headlines last year with its announcement to build a new facility in Zhanjiang with 100% green power. This is an example of direct negotiation. It only works if your power demand and investment are both MASSIVE.   https://t.co/lINz2SjNkh
1485907084931907592 2022-01-25 09:27:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/ So that brings us to the next model: buying green power.  This has become possible in China's wholesale markets over the last year. If you're a huge power consumer, you could buy directly from the source. If you're smaller, you can negotiate a 'subscription' with your utility.
1485907082348208129 2022-01-25 09:27:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/ Different models exist in China, whether you want to own the panels or just lease your roof to a developer who sells you the power.  Major limitations of course are...how big and robust is your roof?  Also volume. Rooftop solar meets mayybe 5% of a large manufacturer's demand.
1485907077616877572 2022-01-25 09:27:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/ Onsite generation is already a mature option in China. Usually this means rooftop solar, although it could also mean nearby generation of solar/wind. Use what you need and sell the excess to the grid. This is called net-metering. But you'll probably mostly self-consume.  https://t.co/BivpzYuiQU
1485907070264426498 2022-01-25 09:27:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/ Okay so how do you actually do this? There are four main ways that are mature now in China:   - Onsite power generation (like rooftop solar) - Green power subscription - Green power direct contract - Renewable energy certificates  Let's discuss each of these.
1485907066900578307 2022-01-25 09:27:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/ Take Apple for example. Apple famously declared that its whole supply chain will be 100% green power by 2030. This means hundreds of suppliers in China have to figure out how to procure green power if they want to keep Apple's business. üí™   https://t.co/EXNfk9d6pZ
1485907061573832706 2022-01-25 09:27:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/ Okay. So companies in China make green power pledges for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes they are part of an int'l program like RE100 or Science Based Targets or GHG Protocol. Sometimes they have their own internal ESG plan.  Sometimes their biggest customer demands it.
1485907058042228743 2022-01-25 09:27:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/ Actually I kind of did a short thread about this back in June of 2021, but a lot has changed since then. Plus I want to expand the information. But here's a link to the old thread anyway:   https://t.co/jvi4YNFEPK

1483332084563611651 2022-01-18 06:55:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> btw I'm obv. not an epidemiologist, so you can safely ignore whatever *I* think would/wouldn't work. I'm not even going there, chill.  I'm talking more about how I think the decision-making process would go down on the Chinese side. Happy to consider counterpoints.
1483332080616767490 2022-01-18 06:55:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You might say "why not do both?". And it might make sense, if they had the resources to do both, and had low confidence that doing only one wouldn't work.   But they don't. Their track record gives every reason to be confident that staying the course or doubling down WILL work.
1483332076573462530 2022-01-18 06:55:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Obv. lockdowns are resource-intensive, economically damaging. But they are the ultimate circuit-breaker, effective in China over and over. Efficacy basically 100%. Better than any vaccine.üôÑ  A nearly sure thing versus a not-sure thing (that yes, also damages pride). No contest.
1483332073830359041 2022-01-18 06:55:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That goes for all for the measures that China has deployed, seemingly very effectively thus far. Why wouldn't they just double/triple down on those first?  Longer quarantines. Deeper contract tracing. Frequent-er testing. Draconian-er lockdowns ü•≤  If all that fails, then maybe.
1483332068751081477 2022-01-18 06:54:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Continuing thoughts: I see no foreign vax anytime soon. And don't think pride is main driving factor.  My instinct is Chn policymakers will assess better returns via more quarantines, contact tracing &amp; lockdowns, than from trying to add 2-3 billion doses of Pfizer to the arsenal.
1483310990813167622 2022-01-18 05:31:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YuanfenYang Putting more resources into testing, lockdowns, tracing, and quarantines seems more bang for buck in terms of prevention.  Maybe if the caseload gets to be much larger than it is now, the small statistical gain in prevention from also using foreign vax would be worth it.

1483118732549705728 2022-01-17 16:47:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TheresaAFallon For the 1.5 years, almost any clusters that appeared were traced back to airport staff or post-quarantine returnees (long incubation).  So if a case pops up with no connection to those, and happens to be a person handling overseas mail, or imported food, it's not a huge leap...
1483116425355341824 2022-01-17 16:38:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TheresaAFallon With basically the whole country behind a very strict (but very effective) 3-week entry quarantine, the human infection vectors are highly controlled.  So it makes sense to investigate the lower-likelihood potential transmission vectors like mail or cold storage.
1483061250884247561 2022-01-17 12:58:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CONSINEO Another (extremely confucian) interpretation is that the under-60s were being treated like stage 4 guinea pigs for the vaccine, thereby protecting the elderly until it was absolutely proven safeüôÉ
1483060354603433991 2022-01-17 12:55:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RabbitChairman Dunno what all the choices are and how they differ. My gf had sinovac before so she got it for her third dose too.
1483059962691858435 2022-01-17 12:53:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CONSINEO Mmm yes,  can imagine that these kinds of nuances are going to be difficult to explain to worried people who hear there is a vaccine, understand they are at high risk, and haven't received a really good explanation as to why they've been excluded.
1483057917247242241 2022-01-17 12:45:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CONSINEO Every announcement on the subject indicated that high-risk job holders were first, as they they'd have the most likelihood to be exposed.   Followed by general population under 60, for which phase 3 trial data was ample.  If you claim other motivations, you must support.
1483057158971596807 2022-01-17 12:42:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CONSINEO The article doesn't support your claim that the elderly were excluded because they aren't a productive part of society. Never heard anyone say that.  The article implies that authorities were hesitant to push vax to elderly when there's no local outbreak and scant Phase 3 data.
1483046096545157122 2022-01-17 11:58:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CONSINEO Got a source for that? I recall at the beginning of the rollout that the elderly were advised to not get vaccines if they had preexisting conditions that made them potentially vulnerable to complications. Nothing about not being a productive part of society...üßê
1483043148100431875 2022-01-17 11:46:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fixedincomer To my knowledge, the answer in Shanghai is no. I think it was possible in SZ maybe (?)
1483042355158876162 2022-01-17 11:43:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is honestly a really nice freebie for getting a vaccine. Nuts (except peanuts) are expensive snacks in China, esp. pecans.  All done up in a nice red CNY gift box the way they were, it would probably retail for like 148 CNY in the grocery. They know what their targets like.
1483041689166290948 2022-01-17 11:41:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shanghai is motivating citizens to get their third dose with free gifts. GF went today...said it was almost all elders (who have been a source of vax hesitancy).  Clever program and good timing to make the freebie some typical CNY hosting snacks.  Almonds, pecans, raisins, etc.  https://t.co/SLXStZ5Vbu

1482301775944519687 2022-01-15 10:40:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Overall, it was a really easy experience and IMO great value for money. I have heard moving can be a really onerous experience elsewhere, but it's really nice here. Everything done via app.  That's it. Hope this helps at least one person, and is mildly interesting for the rest.üòÄ
1482301767832707073 2022-01-15 10:40:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The truck took 4 days from SZ to SH, with boxes delivered on the morning of the 5th. In the end, we didn't need the free warehousing, since we found a place more quickly than expected.  Unloading took ~20 minutes. We had 1 casualty: a broken glass bowl near the top of the box. ü•≤
1482301763508391941 2022-01-15 10:40:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There's also a popular option I didn't take advantage of called the "Japanese-style" Êó•ÂºèÊê¨ÂÆ∂ where they do everything for you, including packing up boxes Marie Kondo style. This one is totally turnkey - you could just go to the mall for the day. Costs much more though, I assume.
1482301758928199685 2022-01-15 10:40:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the end, they calculated me for 6 cubic meters (I felt it was closer to 5, but oh well). Add labor, packaging, and warehousing, was ~3400 CNY total.  So 535 bucks to move my life from Shenzhen to Shanghai.  My SH-SZ move in 2019 was about 30% cheaper, but I had less stuff.
1482301753706319877 2022-01-15 10:40:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The two guys that arrived for pick-up were very high efficiency. Not big burly guys as is stereotypical for moving companies in the US - wiry guys with like 5% body fat hoisting their own bodyweight effortlessly.  Took them less than 30 minutes to get everything in the truck.
1482301749327450112 2022-01-15 10:40:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides the shipping fee, they charged for labor (120 CNY/person/hour) and 100 CNY for special packaging for fragile things (TVs, desktop computers, etc).   There's also an extra stairs fee based on whether your building has an elevator or not &amp; how high the floor is (if not).
1482301739525361664 2022-01-15 10:40:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The moving company we went with is Êòì‰∏∞. They charge 480 CNY/cubic meter, more than their competitors, but they could offer 7 days' free storage in their SH warehouse before delivery (important because at the time we didn't have an apartment yet).  FYI:  https://t.co/GMTaJ90H7X
1482301733800144898 2022-01-15 10:40:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We weren't moving a sofa or home electrics like a fridge, so renting out space in a shared truck made more sense for our neatly-stacked boxes.  I bought a bunch of heavy-duty cardboard boxes and a roll of bubble wrap (for glassware) on Taobao for like 200 RMB total.
1482301712673406976 2022-01-15 10:40:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They have two ways of charging: either you rent out a whole vehicle, or you rent space in a big truck that will be shared with other people making the same move.  For a route like SZ-SH, they have trucks leaving every day, so you would never have to wait for service.
1482301708474945536 2022-01-15 10:40:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay so first you need to book yourself a moving service. You can search for ÈïøÈÄîÊê¨ÂÆ∂ or Ë∑®Â∏ÇÊê¨ÂÆ∂ ('long-distance move', or 'intercity move')...they all have apps or mini-apps in WeChat.  There are quite a few options, so you'll want to shop around a little to find a good deal.
1482301700568678401 2022-01-15 10:40:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, let me say that we have a lot of stuff. I've lived here since 2012 and as soon as I stopped being a student, I started accumulating things.  This recent move was 20 large boxes (no furniture).  I moved from Nanjing to Shanghai to start my career with like...2 suitcases. üòÖ

What she's reporting in the story is basically factual...I'm well aware.  But if I didn't know about Xi'an already, there's no way I would trust her to tell me.
1481481317410029570 2022-01-13 04:20:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> btw I don't adhere to some fairyland dream where reporters are perfect, emotionless, impartial automatons. Some (low) bias level is normal, reasonable.  But there's should be a bottom line before it just becomes Fox, or MSNBC.  Does NYT really want that for their China coverage?
1481479832257310720 2022-01-13 04:14:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you aim for credibility in your news reporting but still talk like this on Twitter, at some point you've got to consider you're just better for op-eds, not the news.  I think it's very naive to trust anyone with this degree of overt personal bias to report the news straight.

I didn't follow the story after.  The answer depends on how much excess coal capacity the system had to absorb the new demand and what would pick up demand next. Which idk.

So I dunno.

1477138927538479104 2022-01-01 04:45:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @intewig I felt bad at first about blocking because I felt like I had abandoned the 'moral high ground' or something. But then realized that's just BS and you gotta take of yourself first. And now I block happily, and even preemptively sometimes, and it's great.

1476931083170058249 2021-12-31 14:59:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 @Hubei_Peasant Yunnan has just started to appear on the radar of coffee people around the world in last few years, but (of course) we've been enjoying it for a while already over here. Makes sense - the climate should be basically similar to Vietnam. I believe Manner uses mostly Yunnan beans.
1476911204052320257 2021-12-31 13:40:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bencsin Seoul coffee culture is also crazy for sure. I'd say a major difference is the number of domestic SK chains - it feels like the market is really dominated by them. Cafe Bene and Twosome Place and Holly's and Pascucci and....  Whereas in SH there are a few chains, but more indy.

1476859860905979905 2021-12-31 10:16:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @macastel3 @HanAsra Biggest differential in cost structure is probably rent if I had to guess.
1476852627283472387 2021-12-31 09:47:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Why the assumption that it's poor quality though?
1476822608729423873 2021-12-31 07:48:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RedPandaInc5605 Yeah a few in each city but not widespread. They were super popular with a huge flagship in Nanjing when I was there from 2012-2014. At the time it was one of the first non-Starbucks/Costa coffee places.  Also UBC Coffee which I think still has a few places...
1476811454632194049 2021-12-31 07:04:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lipsongsun @stillreezy Fun fact: flat white in China is called the "Australian white" most commonly but also the "fu rui bai" where bai is white but fu rui is a approximation of someone saying "flat" with a super thick Chinese accent.

1476796270782005249 2021-12-31 06:04:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rwphan Not to my knowledge but I'm still in SZ. I'll formally move back to SH next weekend.
1476793801284878336 2021-12-31 05:54:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TeachLearnGrow2 Why is that? It's not like it takes away from anything else.  And it's Shanghai btw, not China. On a statistical basis for # of coffee shops.
1476793422996377600 2021-12-31 05:52:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TeachLearnGrow2 Well statistically it's indisuptable. From a culture perspective of course Shanghai has a long way to go. Coffee appreciate and penetration in the younger generations in 1st tier cities quite high, much lower elsewhere ofc.
1476793011853926401 2021-12-31 05:51:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rwphan @William60378254 Mmm I guess right now the scene is SH is dominated by espresso style with fewer places offering hand pours and cold brew, although this is also increasing.  They're mostly going for cozy neighborhood coffee shop feel. There are just a handful of Turkish and Vietnamese places.
1476787472575000579 2021-12-31 05:29:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rwphan @William60378254 I don't think SH has any coffee from America or Europe. Those aren't really known as coffee regions...  A bean-centric place in SH or SZ will normally have 6-10 beans for their SOE pour-overs. Kenya, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yunnan, Colombia and Honduras I'd say are most common.
1476782043765764098 2021-12-31 05:07:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rwphan It's my tactic for enhancing twitter engagement with oz twitter. Give me clicks, twitter algorithm
1476781588792823809 2021-12-31 05:05:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy Well you can't argue with the volume ;)

1476780999497314304 2021-12-31 05:03:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango So many western brands came over here and decided they are now a premium brand. Like nearly EVERY 3-4 star western hotel chain has decided they are a 5-star brand in China.
1476780643828699138 2021-12-31 05:01:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra It started out as an expensive, foreign drink that mostly only westerners would drink, but is now more mainstream for young people. The sheer density of coffee places in SH is overwhelming now.
1476778536572620802 2021-12-31 04:53:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Yeah filter coffee is almost unheard of here. Another thing Starbucks got to define for a generation of Chinese coffee drinkers...that coffee = espresso drinks.
1476778338341457923 2021-12-31 04:52:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 There's about 300 stores now, 250+ of them in Shanghai. They're going bigger soon...   https://t.co/wxqHJUZDcE
1476777974351286273 2021-12-31 04:51:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Mmm good point - Luckin did the cheap coffee thing first, but the coffee was meh and inspired weak brand loyalty.  I read an analysis somewhere about how Luckin is the first to do S'bucks model with China pricing, while Manner is the first to do barista model with China pricing.
1476776543615549443 2021-12-31 04:45:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Perhaps of interest to @ruima
1476776339059339265 2021-12-31 04:44:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Tim Hortons and Peet's both set up operations in China in recent years and still charge 31-35 for lattes.  Surely their management consultants told them a few years ago that 30+ for a latte was fine in China. But they lack S'bucks brand power. Wonder how they'll do long-term?
1476776335817068546 2021-12-31 04:44:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They told me that Shanghai coffee customers are now more knowledgeable about the cost structure of coffee and now expect to pay 20-something for their coffee, instead of 30-something.  Starbucks's products defined coffee for nearly a generation of Chinese, but it's changing.
1476776332134522880 2021-12-31 04:44:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As I guessed, they told me its the Manner Coffee Effect.  With Manner now flooding the SH market and charging just 15 for Americanos and 20 for lattes, new indy coffee shops have to benchmark to Manner's pricing, instead of the old benchmark (Starbucks).  https://t.co/G7vF4m2Fs7
1476776328460312579 2021-12-31 04:44:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I feel many newly opened coffee shops in Shanghai are cheaper than they were back in 2019 when I left. Now Americanos will cost 15-18 CNY and lattes 20-24 CNY (compared to ~25 CNY and 30 before, respectively). Go check!   I had my hypothesis as to why, so I asked a few baristas..
1476776324890972160 2021-12-31 04:44:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Random SH coffee thread:   Some people already know that SH has quietly become the coffee capital of the world. Some streets literally have 5 places within 100m.  But I recently noticed something else: the pricing is changing too...it's getting cheaper.   https://t.co/CUkj3Qc0Fp
1476604466249932800 2021-12-30 17:21:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ngzeonhou @freqflyer_ck Frankly I'd love to see such a thing. Can you imagine the DOC telling US corporations they need to prove their goods procured in China were made with XX% green power, else face an N% import duty?  Right now this is only done via corporate ESG programs.
1476601601552896003 2021-12-30 17:10:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ngzeonhou @freqflyer_ck If the tax was onerous enough, they would have to seek to procure more green power at the manufacturing level to avoid the tax.   "China" is not an abstract factory that just dumps stuff into Walmarts. There are corporations in the middle.
1476601035493822474 2021-12-30 17:08:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ngzeonhou @freqflyer_ck Manufacturers in China procure power as a cost item. If they contract with a power utility for "brown power" they get brown power. If they contract for green power they get green.  A carbon tax would have to be levied on the manufacturers importing into the US for this to work.
1476600479689834496 2021-12-30 17:06:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ngzeonhou @freqflyer_ck It's Indonesia (Oz is #2) but that's kinda besides the point.  None of Frum's commentary on this point makes any sense - it's not just a China ignorance problem, but a power sector ignorance problem.

Won't work though - it's not my first day on the internet...sorry. Enjoy your titular self-proscribed role. You're doing great.
1476535500345249793 2021-12-30 12:47:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lugan Anyway, I laid out my thought process clearly &amp; I think you misread it (whether intentionally or unintentionally I can't say) so if it doesn't resonate with you, then good for you - you've had a different experience as a China expat in 2021. Now go be someone else's reply guy.

1476398964870049796 2021-12-30 03:45:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lugan Well like I said here, it's fine to disagree on stuff, but we gotta set the foundational parts first- if we can't agree on these things, then we're going to have a miserable time.   https://t.co/J0DsSdUh5Z

Come2hk only works if you've been in Guangdong for the three weeks before going to HK and return2hk only works if you have a HK ID. So seems chances are slim.
1476241166832070658 2021-12-29 17:18:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolay21585555 what
1476179581690257413 2021-12-29 13:13:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZzGgWw5 @Elvenmonk Exactly. I'm happy to be with people I disagree with, as long as I like and respect them. I don't want to be with people I don't like.  For example if you don't like living in China and complain about it all the time...then we just don't have a good foundation for friendship.

1476176591159906305 2021-12-29 13:01:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @suhasrbhat It was actually while I was in HK for a few months that I started thinking about this.   It's way trickier in Hong Kong and you have to be very subtle. As a white foreigner in HK, I felt most people assumed I would be very negative about China.
1476175473159720960 2021-12-29 12:57:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MrSeanHaines We're talking about foundational stuff to establish if someone is a reasonable person or not. I'm happy to listen to people I disagree with if I respect them. And I have the right to decide who earns my respect.

1476087298378788864 2021-12-29 07:06:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChongXuCheng Being far from my family and bureaucratic systems/procedures that are not designed to include me are my two big ones.
1476085114157207553 2021-12-29 06:58:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kyotoloather Oh yeah? How so?
1476084638816751616 2021-12-29 06:56:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Aizazadi_ Lol well that's a big tautological, but yeah I hope my filtration method makes sure I am left with reasonable people. So that even if we disagree on other China stuff, it'll be based on logic that I can respect, even if I don't personally agree.
1476084245290389505 2021-12-29 06:54:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China "Hey, I'm David, nice to meet you. Have you seen what the washington post said yesterday goddamn it was stupid. Soooo what do you do here?"
1476083695077396482 2021-12-29 06:52:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Aizazadi_ More important than agreeing China's covid response is good (which honestly should be super easy to agree) is agreeing how so many perspectives of China in the West are biased/wrong.  There are people who live here who still get all their news from western media for example.üôÉ
1476080256079458305 2021-12-29 06:38:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So it's self-selection about being happy here. This self-selection bias also applies to the people who leave - more likely to be negative.  I've always been pretty positive about my life here, despite various drawbacks, so it feels like it's gotten easier to find My People.  End
1476080252325543937 2021-12-29 06:38:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It feels like a courtship on the first date, as you subtly dance around trying to figure out if you're going to get along when it comes to China Stuff.  The good news for me is: people who are still here after 2 years of covid are far more likely to be positive and cool.
1476080246071836675 2021-12-29 06:38:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. If you get to  where you can agree China covid response = good and mainstream population/media narratives on China = poor, you can have a nice chat.  You won't necessarily be on the same page on every China topic (nor should you be) but at least you've got table stakes.
1476080242506678275 2021-12-29 06:38:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. If you're in agreement, ramp it up a bit. Drop some specific easy examples like: "can you believe they've been reporting we have food rationing?" or "you know tons of people believe that millions secretly died in Wuhan? So weird to hear..."  Make sure they're still with you...
1476080239033741313 2021-12-29 06:38:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. The tricky part. From China covid measures, transition to Western perceptions of China's covid coverage. Keep the critique light and vague at first. Like "yeah it just seems like people back home have no idea what it's like here".  See how they react to this.
1476080235330166788 2021-12-29 06:38:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Transition to discussing something like e.g. China covid measures. Drop a phrase like: "yeah the quarantine and tracing measures are tough, but on the flipside, we get to enjoy a relatively normal life through all of this".   See how they react to this before proceeding.
1476080231836372993 2021-12-29 06:38:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So here's my 2022 guide to Figuring Out if Foreigners you Meet in China are Your People:  1. Start subtle. e.g. Generally mutter about foreign countries' handling of covid, but vaguely, and avoid direct comparison with China. Establish mutual ground on a easily-agreeable topic.
1476080228187344896 2021-12-29 06:38:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Something I've noted over the past year:   There are fewer foreigners in China than 2019, but it seems the ones still here are more likely to be "my people", i.e. we get along and we have similar perspectives on our life in China.  A short thread about finding "My People" (tm)

1475326669665619968 2021-12-27 04:44:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peijin_zhang @realsteelmuslim I mean if you're a foreigner learning Chinese in Beijing I guess it's useful. Your friend says "meet me at ÁßØÊ∞¥ÊΩ≠Á´ô"  and you look at the subway map and maybe you don't know the characters yet but now you can search by pinyin.  But how many people could that actually apply to...?
1475325916746108933 2021-12-27 04:41:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peijin_zhang @realsteelmuslim It looks like they are doing all three (from the first sign anyway). Characters, full pinyin, and then English.  But I'm not sure who the full pinyin is for? Chinese readers use the Chinese and non-Chinese read the English and who exactly needs to read 'remin daxue?'...lol
1475323356417200130 2021-12-27 04:31:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim @peijin_zhang There's more confusion potential for how they're changing the name entirely from Chn to Eng.  Like Êñ∞È¶ñÈí¢ doesn't have the word "park" anywhere in it. But the English station is Shougang Park. If you told me you were going to Shougang Park Station I'd be looking for a È¶ñÈí¢ÂÖ¨Âõ≠Á´ô
1475322135086174216 2021-12-27 04:26:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim @peijin_zhang It's not a translation anymore, but it will take visitors to Beijing about 20 seconds to learn that Zhan means station and then it'll be fine.  I think there's a parallel in how Bangkok labels small roads "Soi" instead of translating "Alley". Now everyone knows what a Soi is.
1475315111329890306 2021-12-27 03:58:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim I happen to be meeting up with such a friend tonight - I'll ask her haha
1475314571778748420 2021-12-27 03:56:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim Which suggests it's not specifically the American-ness that inspires the occasionally discriminatory treatment, but rather the lack of expected Chinese-ness.
1475314238822387712 2021-12-27 03:54:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @realsteelmuslim From what I've heard from Chn diaspora who come to China, it cuts both ways - treated preferentially in some ways (still not as well as white foreigners) and definitely discriminated against in others.  But it's not just for being Chn-American. This would apply for Chn-Anything.

1474930813137350659 2021-12-26 02:31:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rapidchair @przidnt1 @Molson_Hart It was quite the rigamarole to get me a work permit in Shanghai (until recently I was still contracted in HK). We used the state-owned labor service company (FESCO) as an agent, so it went easily enough, but with so, so many steps.

And you have to be able to interview for and then take a job via vidchat.  There's a handful of new arrivals around town, but very few overall.  Few could imagine how utterly normal life is here, unless your city has a few cases.
1474818525000658946 2021-12-25 19:05:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 Yeah that's weird. Objectively speaking you're way more aggressive than I am.  I have caught a fair number of blocks like this though...never spoken to them but they find my existence offensive somehow.

1474697661458489347 2021-12-25 11:04:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orbitala Well it IS the holidays...so I'd expect that right now too. Compare to the shipping bedlam that is China on or immediately after 11.11...
1474692310524776453 2021-12-25 10:43:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orbitala It was split into several different parcels of fragile items (wine). I think that's how the price ended up so high.  I changed the order so it met the shipper's minimum free shipping threshold and felt much better about it. But it will still take 7-10 business days.

1474261442987577345 2021-12-24 06:11:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @christheoracle In such a hypothetical, I think China would have serious social and economic stability issues. It has applied great effort to forestall such a scenario.   America is seemingly tolerant and even benumbed to incompetence of governance - stability thanks to lack of accountability.

Opinion journalism is the weakest form of journalism, where you openly admit you've abandoned journalistic impartiality in favor of promoting your worldviews.

1466784907389063170 2021-12-03 15:02:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PolluxTechnical @YanQinyq Power prices passed onto industrial end-users are going to be 10-15% higher than before - probably not enough to justify moving a supply chain. We'll see it passed on to prices is my bet. More apparently in power-intensive industries where electricity is a bigger chunk of costs.
1466715267908571144 2021-12-03 10:25:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So even if coal production ends up in relative glut in 2022, prices are unlikely to return to the lows of the past.   This matters, of course, because it means wholesale power prices are likely to remain high next year.  I hope this gives a stronger build signal to RE developers.
1466710172877803524 2021-12-03 10:05:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I would also like to announce that I beat @YanQinyq to announce some Chinese energy news for the first time ever, which makes this a very successful Friday in my book. üòâ
1466709548505657348 2021-12-03 10:03:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On a different app, a power industry media surveyed readers what we think will happen to coal prices next year.  I chose "prices will be higher than the benchmark" as an answer for both long-term and monthly contracts. This appears to match the majority opinion..  https://t.co/IZMV9Tfat4
1466708068075401218 2021-12-03 09:57:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Upon this 700 CNY/mt benchmark, coal contract prices will "float" up or down 150 CNY/mt (~21%), based on the average price of  4 different domestic coal price indices.  This is still quite a bit lower than current spot trading prices:  https://t.co/A2cRwS4Xzh
1466708064933797891 2021-12-03 09:57:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is the benchmark level to be consulted when coal miners and power plants sign medium/long-term coal supply contracts for 2022.  The upwards adjustment from 535 CNY/mt appears to be an acknowledgement that coal next year is going to remain pricier than its historical levels.
1466708061532291073 2021-12-03 09:57:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Big news on China coal price policy this afternoon:  At the National Coal Trading assembly, NDRC released its exposure draft policy to raise the benchmark price for steam coal in 2022 to 700 CNY/mt, nearly 31% higher than it was previously (535 CNY/mt).   https://t.co/kq5tFbP6JK

1466453286362308610 2021-12-02 17:04:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's a picture from Wikipedia. As you can see it was literally an exposed pile of bricks and graphite and uranium pellets...  @nuclearkatie has an awesome souvenir and I'm super jealous  Wikipedia for the curious about this fascinating piece of history:   https://t.co/rnyKZZ2FGB  https://t.co/idBzG043S4
1466451779445407744 2021-12-02 16:58:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Fun fact: Nuclear reactors today are STILL called ÂèçÂ∫îÂ†Ü in Chinese, which is literally "Reaction Pile"  This is a direct reference to the first nuclear chain reaction Katie mentions here, which is the famous Chicago Pile.   December 2, 1942, the dawn of the fission age.
1466439758717071367 2021-12-02 16:10:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wokeglobaltimes 80k followers, getting 1 whole like per tweet. Grim.
1466288248423022597 2021-12-02 06:08:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 My kitchen? Yes.  I'm gonna live-tweet my Thanksgiving/holiday meal preparation again this year I think. Although it's late this year because I had to do quarantine, I refuse to miss a year.
1466230682229694464 2021-12-02 02:20:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN With educated guessing lol.  Big opportunity for variation here based on how honest you're being with yourself :)  https://t.co/5QQgH5taIZ
1466022988235431940 2021-12-01 12:34:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Atomicrod It would have to be some kind of flow-induced vibration, right? Some hydrodynamics issue caused by the interior architecture of the vessel? I dunno I'm spitballing here hah.  Yep, 4 months during a power crisis. CGN guys have been complaining endlessly.
1466020163065561091 2021-12-01 12:23:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And if the issue is design-related, there's likely nothing the operator (CGN) could have done differently. This is something that needs to be sorted out on the design side, in France.  As for whether the plant *needed* to go into emergency stoppage over this. Err, likely no.
1466020160788045830 2021-12-01 12:23:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To remind everyone, damaged fuel roads aren't particularly dangerous or rare, but they are undesirable. And if a design flaw is causing them to appear more often, EDF must do root-cause analysis, esp. since Taishan 2, Flamanville, Okiluoto, Hinkley C all use the same design.
1466020157776486403 2021-12-01 12:23:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know June 2021 might as well be in the last millennium as far as Twitter is concerned, so here's my commentary from when the Chinese regulator announced the plant would be shut down:  (the Chinese link is broken now)   https://t.co/zNU9IKcDjC
1466020154714705921 2021-12-01 12:23:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Remember the Taishan nuclear power plant fuel rod kerfuffle from a few months ago?  Inspections still underway, but a French engineering source claims the rod damage caused by excessive vibration of the fuel in the core, something to do with the EPR's RPV.  *This is UNCONFIRMED*
1466003390878543882 2021-12-01 11:17:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Atomicrod Yes Taishan 1 is still down. Per the CRIIRAD whistleblower claims, if RPV design is leading to excessive rod vibration and fuel failure (via GTRF?) then it implies a problem likely to repeat across the EPR fleet. Not particularly dangerous, but annoying and maybe expensive...
1465997688369860609 2021-12-01 10:54:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt Yeah I only really thought a few days ago about how the default definition of cider is different from USA to EUR.  In the US we'd specify "hard cider" if it's the fermented, alcoholic kind.
1465995977949515777 2021-12-01 10:47:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And I'm garnishing with a burnt cinnamon stick of course, because I know that's how you justify charging 98 RMB for a cocktail in this city.
1465994350584741889 2021-12-01 10:41:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have mixed my cider with Fireball to make a boozy apple-cinnamon homemade holiday highball and it is very dangerous and very good.
1465966703871885316 2021-12-01 08:51:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @taro_taylor @AFP I wonder what this guy is like in person.  Does Twitter make people say dumb, smug stuff that they wouldn't say IRL, or would he actually talk like his?

1465923442801143808 2021-12-01 05:59:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN I'd imagine they might score better in the week after they just finished gaokao prep than someone who's been graduated for years, perhaps even if they have BA or MA lol
1465922662614528002 2021-12-01 05:56:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN Like gaokao only, no college?
1465920750930456579 2021-12-01 05:48:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN Yeah I really wanted an accurate score for the # of characters so I tried to avoid even that kind of 'cheating'. Maybe I'll try it again later with guessing to see if I can inflate a bit. And get my gf to take it as a benchmark.
1465917818587602946 2021-12-01 05:36:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN That's a nice score! I didn't want to skew the results so I didn't even guess for any of the questions I didn't know and just clicked "I don't know".
1465916804820205574 2021-12-01 05:32:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN On the other hand, I've taken the test on this other site dozens of times and gotten everywhere from 2800 to 4400. Seems a lot of variation between tests for this second one, and probably quite a bit less scientific. But still interesting.   https://t.co/JTawI9mRyg
1465916339831205888 2021-12-01 05:31:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN That's a commonly cited figure, but I wonder how many actually know 3500.  I took the test on this site and got 3182 characters. Which was in the 48th percentile (which seems lousy, but against, I assume, mostly native speakers, I'm totally happy with).   https://t.co/uNYNvW74Fh
1465907206914654210 2021-12-01 04:54:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN And then the gaslighting, implying it's a bad faith argument to demand high competency in Chinese to do a good job.  I haven't spent 11 goddamn years immersed in Chinese for you to tell me your HSK4 is good enough. Fuck you very much.
1465905584511750150 2021-12-01 04:48:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN If 10 is native speaker, anything less than an 8 is basically unacceptable here.  This space is full of A. capability inflation and B. understating the level of competency that is necessary to do credible work.  Extremely annoying for those of us that have really put in the work.
1465640581661540358 2021-11-30 11:15:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @isabelhilton Read the article and felt the sensational title and lede were weakly backed up by the details in the piece.

1465166678057271296 2021-11-29 03:52:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ArtistSalon @MareikeOhlberg I don't think I'm being subtle at all - quite explicit in fact.   If you have a professional persona based on being an expert of "Chinese CCP bots" on Twitter, it's a big problem if you get it wrong and target the wrong accounts. Who would want to read your books or papers?
1465163038881951744 2021-11-29 03:37:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MareikeOhlberg ..which would be worrying for most people, to target someone falsely.  But should be even more worrying for you, since your professional credibility is based on being an expert of  Chinese digital governance.  Not clear why you'd want to draw more attention to your mistake?
1465162336482824192 2021-11-29 03:34:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MareikeOhlberg Have you addressed the response of the person you targeted? They have responded on that thread, on this tweet, and on their own page, denying your accusations. Do you have more proof?  Maybe you didn't violate the Twitter rules, but it also seems you missed your target?

1464174973807783939 2021-11-26 10:11:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'll be having my holiday dinner with turkey and gravy and pumpkin pie NEXT weekend.

1464168177533816833 2021-11-26 09:44:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If the costs of offshore wind have *actually* decreased that much over 4 years and the industry can stand on its own, it'll be a BIG win.  If it doesn't happen, then newbuild dries up.  It's currently ~0.75CNY/kWh, so will need to come down ~40% in Guangdong. Good luck!
1464168172118970375 2021-11-26 09:44:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In practice, the grid company will pay the 'market price' for the power, and the provincial government will subsidize with extra money/kWh.  This subsidy will decrease each year and disappear in 2025, which is when the wind power is supposed to reach "grid-parity" in Guangdong.
1464168166754373639 2021-11-26 09:44:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's a kind of gamble: offer attractive returns in the short run, let the supply chain scale up, and cross your fingers that the greater scale/improving technology work together to bring costs down by 2025.  It worked before for onshore wind and PV:   https://t.co/rYfCkifveg
1464168160429367298 2021-11-26 09:44:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For my followers who aren't in the industry: subsidizing here means a guaranteed price at which the power is sold.  This price will be higher than the 'market price' for power, to cover the higher cost of developing offshore wind.   https://t.co/IFeHuKAcX9
1464168155941519360 2021-11-26 09:44:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pretty cool - I didn't realize Guangdong had formally targeted getting offshore wind power to grid-parity by 2025.  Basically that means they will subsidize offshore wind at decreasing levels from 2021-2025, and then offer no subsidies at all after that.   https://t.co/BITIIBvcbE

Bu neither place should be defined by its asterisks.
1463740929404071942 2021-11-25 05:26:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jabl5106 @gonglei89 @ruima @yabubian @antonmalkin @laurimyllyvirta It's fair to separate different socioeconomic tiers and compare across them.  i.e. are the wealthy/middle-class/poor etc. of SH living better/worse/equal to their respective counterparts in WV?  The QoL gap is larger/smaller at varying levels, sure. Overall I'd think SH wins.

Not only is a disingenous red herring to argue this point, it's also largely moot.

1463688212807831559 2021-11-25 01:57:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread I love this
1463525513020907522 2021-11-24 15:10:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread They probably buy it outright.  Lianjia currently has a 2000 sqm space on the 20th floor for 137‰∏á per month. So that's 215k USD a month.  So 15k sqm renting would probably be like 1.5M USD a month?
1463501748090261520 2021-11-24 13:36:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ex8ted Liked the visuals and the incorporation of Chinese mythology.  (surprisingly) liked Awkwafina and thought they had good on-screen chemistry as buds.  That was about it.
1463501037474500608 2021-11-24 13:33:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ex8ted Nope downloaded it.  Yeah I felt the chemistry between those two was very poor/nonexistent. As was with his sister, who had ZERO development.  Pacing, writing, mediocre. The same damn 3rd act CGI overload we see in  https://t.co/jB0ZD4vaAH.  And surprisingly uncharismatic lead.

I'd have happily taken one or two less CGI slugfests for an extra 10-15 minutes of developing their relationship to make me care as an audience member

1463465005509083146 2021-11-24 11:10:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chinahelpdesk I didn't like the new Bond either.  It's pretty rare that I like anything blockbustery that shows up in Chinese theaters. The last thing I saw in Chinese theaters that I really liked was Knives Out and I have no idea how that film made it into the annual quota.
1463463140952195078 2021-11-24 11:02:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally got around to seeing Shang Chi.  Very meh.   Surprised by the high ratings tbh.

1463355918918119424 2021-11-24 03:56:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @US_China_Menu @TweetDisliker The US tacks on additional rules for defining "democracy" beyond demos kratos because it has contort the defintion to fit itself.  "a democracy must have X parties"  "a democracy must have regularly scheduled popularity contests"  Never mind the outcomes are undemocratic.

1463054765139578881 2021-11-23 08:00:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham I think those funds are intended to incentivize green generation projects by reducing cost of capital and allowing a wider range of projects to meet the investors' hurdle rates?
1463052666439966725 2021-11-23 07:51:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham It's good timing if you're trying to launch a corporate ESG plan. Brown power prices are already rising by 10-15%, so it's really smooth timing it you wanted to bring in some green power at the same time for another 5% more. Hide the smaller cost hike inside the big one.
1463051926384386048 2021-11-23 07:48:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham That should be one of the factors leading to higher green power demand but there are others too.  Biggest one I think is corporate ESG demand picking up due to the launch of green power trading in the wholesale markets since Sept.

It's like asking for a disount on a hotel during October Holiday because you want to book for the whole holiday. They don't care that your stay is longer...they'll rent out that room no matter what, at a better price! You have no leverage.
1463050037076926465 2021-11-23 07:41:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting: We're hearing power suppliers in China are refusing to sell large (bulk) volumes of green power to any individual customer.  There are so many different companies demanding green power right now, they prefer to chop it up and make higher margins on multiple sales.
1463045019208753158 2021-11-23 07:21:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @gonglei89 I live next to a big mall and I know at least three restaurants in the mall that have their employee dorms in my building...  Large units in my building are 3BR. I wonder how many people are actually staying in one that's been subdivided... üò≥
1463044472334426114 2021-11-23 07:19:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @gonglei89 Yes agreed. Although at that socioeconomic level we're talking about totally different labour regimes.  It's not only SOEs that provide ÂåÖÂêÉÂåÖ‰Ωè. I think most migrant worker-type jobs  (factories, construction, service industry) get those things covered. Very basic of course.
1463041064986681348 2021-11-23 07:05:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @waldmenschen Not sure how well that metric can account for social labor conventions (if at all). In China, employers usually will provide basic housing and meals for lower income workers in restaurants, retail, services, etc. So actual purchasing power of workers in Shanghai is murkier.
1463036908217552901 2021-11-23 06:49:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @gonglei89 Then look at it in terms of purchasing power of, say, a minimum hourly wage earner in Shanghai vs. that of one in West Virginia. How far does one day's salary at minimum wage go?  And keep in mind that in China, minimum wage earners almost certain have ÂåÖÂêÉÂåÖ‰Ωè from the employer.

1462740996932788234 2021-11-22 11:13:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Going by my gut, I'm more concerned about Chinese developers aping into clean energy projects in countries that more mature investors would consider too risky.   Once they take a bath once or twice, (and they all will sooner or later) they'll be a lot more gun-shy.
1462740095790845956 2021-11-22 11:09:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course the repart√©e to "buy Chinese" is for the host country to require the project to "buy local".  Which is well within their rights to do.  But if the goal is for the project to be profitable, (and it usually is) the Chinese panels are going to be cheaper.

1462433490847232008 2021-11-21 14:51:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @acosgrove003 Provinces have different hydropower on-grid prices. It's generally cheaper than coal in a given province by 0.1-0.2 CNY/kWh.   This link is Chinese, but the orange table slightly down the page in Section 2 has the on-grid hydropower rate for several provinces in the right column.
1462423525449355267 2021-11-21 14:11:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @acosgrove003 As in montly hydropower generation? Yeah China Electricity Council publishes monthly stats with a slight delay.  Do you mean RPS requirements for specific industries across different provinces?

1462408562181754885 2021-11-21 13:12:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KieHirako9700 Actually I think most of Tibet's power comes from hydropower already, so probably no need for subsidies.  Tibet data is always reported separately from the rest of the nation. This paper discusses it:    https://t.co/U4lY8hnyWe
1462405801566367753 2021-11-21 13:01:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KieHirako9700 Tibet is not part of the RPS scheme. Tibet is usually excluded from basically anything that would mess with power prices and affect economic development.

1462299534155915269 2021-11-21 05:59:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is actually the bulk of what I do these days at work: helping corporations understand how to procure green power in China.  It feels like 2021 has been a turning point in this regard. Way more interest from companies, especially after the sector reforms. I'm very busy. üòÖ
1462299531047886848 2021-11-21 05:59:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Companies that are looking to establish a new factory in China and have their own green energy consumption goals shoul look closely at SW China right now. Or if you're looking for a "green supplier", maybe look for one in Sichuan...or Qinghai.  Assuming your RPS terms allow this.
1462299524576071680 2021-11-21 05:59:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because of the GECs, I can't automatically assume that the power I consumed from the wall outlet in Shenzhen in 2021 is actually 29% renewables.  It may be, but you need to do due diligence by checking GEC transactions and see how your local grid company has been buying power.
1462299521254248455 2021-11-21 05:59:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. Provincial grid companies can buy Chinese Green Energy Certificates (GECs) to get their numbers up if they're struggling to actually procure enough green energy to hit their quota.  This is problematic, as GECs are often double-counted. This is a story for a different thread.
1462299517676494850 2021-11-21 05:59:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some important things to consider about RPS in China:   1. Power can be bought and sold across provinces, via UHV lines. Look at e.g. Shanghai, which targets ~30% hydropower but obviously has none locally.  2. Nuclear does not count toward RPS.   https://t.co/fPQzab9bSe
1462299512337170438 2021-11-21 05:59:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When we say "the province" has to consume XX% of renewable power, this means by proxy the provincial grid company (a subsidiary of State Grid or Southern Grid).  Other companies that are subject to RPS quotas are anyone engaging in direct power trading in the wholesale markets.
1462299508730068999 2021-11-21 05:59:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As you can see from the chart in the first tweet, provinces with good renewable resources are able to set very aggressive targets.  Sichuan targeted 70% renewables in 2021 (thanks to abundant hydro). Shandong struggles to get to 10%.  Here's 2022 goals:  https://t.co/imjPhCcgcV
1462299505424945153 2021-11-21 05:59:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In China, RPS is mandated at national level, but set on a provincial basis. All provinces work toward a long-term goal by e.g. 2030, but also have a mandate for annual incremental increase.  The RPS program was launched in 2019 and has gotten progessively stricter year-over-year.
1462299501989748737 2021-11-21 05:59:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Although it shouldn't have to be, RPS in the US is quite political.  "Blue states" are far more likely to have RPS goals than "red states", and the most ambitious RPS programs are essentially all blue states.   https://t.co/601fX4PmND
1462299498697269251 2021-11-21 05:59:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Many national or sub-national governments have adopted RPS targets to support a decarbonization timeline. USA has no national RPS, but around 30  states do.  Take my home state of Maine, for instance, which has a goal of 80% renewable power by 2030:  https://t.co/grvheG4cbF

1460911654359617536 2021-11-17 10:04:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham Hmm...outside of my area, sorry.  I know it's very expensive right now though. e.g. in this Yicai article it's stated that rising natural gas prices have led to a 30% rise in the price of Guangdong ceramics:    https://t.co/IexjSxOpx8
1460910690504302593 2021-11-17 10:00:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Thanks @laurimyllyvirta and also @AngelicaOung for asking good questions and keeping me honest.
1460910687337660420 2021-11-17 10:00:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So in conclusion: We're largely over the hump, but power curbs remain for some energy-intensive industries.  AND these are probably more to do with lingering tight supply and less to do with dual control.  Similar economically, but obviously way less desirable politically.
1460910683533418499 2021-11-17 10:00:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not to mention, curbing power would only be a short term fix/ not really a fix for the dual controls issues.  Which I knew before but forgot:    https://t.co/JSUndOusF2
1460910680408690689 2021-11-17 10:00:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> You can Google/Baidu any of these phrases along with ÂèåÊéß or ‰∏§È´ò to find the relevant speeches and statements where various leaders or pundits criticised the poor application of these policies to curb power.  I find it less likely they would be used to curb power right now.
1460910677338456065 2021-11-17 10:00:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. National and provincial leadership have repeatedly emphasized over past two months that blind development Áõ≤ÁõÆÂèëÂ±ï of the dual control policies must be curbed, and that you can't use a one size fits all ‰∏ÄÂàÄÂàá approach. Power supply must be guaranteed before emissions goals.
1460910674226212868 2021-11-17 10:00:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Provincial governments have adopted curbing measures that appear to be disconnected from Dual-Control.  e.g. Hebei, who makes it clear here that they're curbing power to steel industry to prioritize winter heating...indicating very tight supply.  https://t.co/qPQlQJVnwI
1460910671176949761 2021-11-17 10:00:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It wasn't widely reported at the time, but it was going on. Yes power prices are 20% higher now versus what generators were getting in July-Aug, but logically there are still generators out there unable to make money and thus unwilling to operate like back in July-Aug.
1460910664688357376 2021-11-17 10:00:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> While State Grid and Southern Grid have both made announcements that power curbs have been alleviated, *except for high-emitting, high-consuming industries*, they don't indicate how to attribute the curbs that remain.  Two possible scenarios then:   https://t.co/H6fuSQOj91
1460910661202972679 2021-11-17 10:00:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta has pointed out it's difficult to know if the curbs still in place are really due to dual controls or still some degree of scarcity caused by pricy coal/generators unwilling to operate.  Having considered/researched further, I agree and want to make a correction:
1460902290794057732 2021-11-17 09:27:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @AngelicaOung I've been doing more research on provincial statements about power curbs vis a vis dual-controls and am working on a tweet to make a revision. I now am thinking it's more like B instead of A.
1460893259241189378 2021-11-17 08:51:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @AngelicaOung From gridco perspective it's either:   A. Actually I have enough power for everyone but I choose to deny supply for you in accordance with policy  B. Actually I don't have enough power for everyone so it's convenient that I can deny supply supply to you in accordance with policy
1460892043069198344 2021-11-17 08:46:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I acknowledge it has a stricter legal definition, but my feeling is that Chinese domestic media has been using it more loosely, as a contrast to emergency load shedding  ÊãâÈó∏ÈôêÁîµ like what happened in Dongbei.   Or as a general euphemism that sounds nicer than ÂÅúÁîµ...
1460891394684305410 2021-11-17 08:43:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Okay so looking at the first sentence of the first article:  Èô§‰∏™Âà´ÁúÅ‰ªΩ„ÄÅÂ±ÄÈÉ®Êó∂ÊÆµÂØπÈ´òËÄóËÉΩ„ÄÅÈ´òÊ±°Êüì‰ºÅ‰∏öÈááÂèñÊúâÂ∫èÁî®ÁîµÊé™ÊñΩÂ§ñÔºåÂÖ®ÁΩëÊúâÂ∫èÁî®ÁîµËßÑÊ®°Êé•ËøëÊ∏ÖÈõ∂  You think it's meaningful that they use ÊúâÂ∫èÁî®Áîµ to refer to the curbs still in place for high-consuming, high-polluting industry?
1460886329198137346 2021-11-17 08:23:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta State Grid/Southern Grid also had their respective announcements that the power curbs were done, except for dual control "ordered power use". Take those for what  you will üòâ (generators very well could still be losing Ôø•...Ôºâ   https://t.co/kPtwu7p90A   https://t.co/Et3bRjnO3y
1460884254032752640 2021-11-17 08:15:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Hmm. Yes. Fair enough. It's planned service interruptions, not emergency load shedding, which doesn't in and of itself speak to whether the service interruption is due to dual control or scarcity due to generator unwillingness to operate.
1460882137507250180 2021-11-17 08:06:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta With domestic spot mine-mouth at 900CNY+/mt, I don't know what that means for long-term supply contracts. 600? 700? 800? Somewhere in there I guess?
1460881546156470282 2021-11-17 08:04:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Well impossible to know 100%, but among our clients, the only ones still facing curbs are in high consumption industries, and the reason they're being told is for ÊúâÂ∫èÁî®Áîµ, not ÂÅúÁîµÈôêÁîµ.  To prove definitively we'd need more intel on the price of long-term coal supply contracts.
1460868619034787844 2021-11-17 07:13:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 I think I'm exhibiting the effect of civilization's degeneracy, not the cause :)

1460866745015488515 2021-11-17 07:05:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Yeah. Energy intensive manufacturers still face curbs if they exceed the industry benchmarks for their respective industry.  Big datasheet on benchmarks for targeted industries released just two days ago. Have been meaning to dig into it more deeply...   https://t.co/gFLK76xSTz
1460858623794429952 2021-11-17 06:33:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Do I even English?  I am fundamentally incapable of tweeting a serious thread without tons of word vomit.  My shitposts are never full of typos like this üôÑ
1460856027927121921 2021-11-17 06:23:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And of course power is still more expensive than it was before, reflecting the cost of steam coal. This is an expected outcome of the sector reform.  These higher prices will remain until coal gets cheaper, which probably won't be until the end of the winter heating season.
1460856024034729985 2021-11-17 06:23:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> No we still DO still have power curbs in some for some industries for to the "Dual Controls policies, related to reducing energy intensity and consumption. That's different. That's not power rationing due to scarcity, and it will continue into next year.  Image: Lantau Group  https://t.co/yopWvMFkCC
1460855996578893826 2021-11-17 06:23:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By the end of the month/early-November things had stabilized.  Now: -Coal futures now trading ~800CNY/mt -Coal production up -Plant inventories up to 21 days -Previously curbed manufacturers have resumed production  (Via linked article):  https://t.co/7VOo0Nc4Vh
1460855992342573058 2021-11-17 06:23:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For background, note that back on October 18, power supply had stabilized somewhat, but coal pricing was still going crazy, which prompted direct policy intervention on the 19th, with immediate effect.   https://t.co/2djelszI4w
1460855988530008070 2021-11-17 06:23:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> FYI, China power rationing has been basically ‚Äòbetter‚Äô since late October, when reforms took effect and coal prices stabilized.  I've noticed a lot of people still don't know. We rarely see media coverage for the resolution of a crisis like this - only its onset or deepening.

1460532502318051332 2021-11-16 08:57:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed @DanielDumbrill The second week of home quarantine in SZ is only available to arrivals from HK, so there's that.   If you've been in SZ for the last 14 days, you can look into the Come2hk scheme which is quarantine free. It's roughly equivalent to the Return2hk which Dan and I used.
1460514417678839809 2021-11-16 07:45:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GollardofArabia HK to SZ specifically is 14+7. The final 7 is "home monitoring", so not enforced quarantine but you're supposed to avoid crowded public places. I applied to do the second half of the 14 at home.  Shenzhen is strict 21 for people arriving from places other than HK, same as SH.
1460512988813664256 2021-11-16 07:40:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From Thursday I'll do my 2nd week at home. My gf will take one for the team (by which I mean she's checking into a nice hotel). üôè  Trading one isolation cell for another, except the home one has better mattress and wifi. And I can cook!   (let's be honest - I'm not gonna cook)
1460512982861967367 2021-11-16 07:40:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But that's sus since definitely have left for longer before (e.g. xmas) and have never had my registration cancelled...  Kinda think they just didn't want me to do home quarantine so they Ê≤°ËØùÊâæËØù until they were out of excuses.   Anyway, I'm approved for home quarantine now! üòÖ
1460512975761002496 2021-11-16 07:40:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After dancing around with hotel staff, quarantine officers, and Á§æÂå∫Âäû for three days, I finally found the right guy who told me my household registration is automatically deleted from the system if I leave for longer than a month.  I was in HK for 7 weeks. üôÑ

1460434882656493573 2021-11-16 02:29:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @djysrv I'd be very surprised if that was the case. These sites were planned for 15 years. Taohuajiang was scheduled to FCD in late 2011. Major equipment was delivered onsite and everything.  Sina reported CNNC sank 600M USD into it before cancellation.   https://t.co/B2oTU6QZ8O

The "integrated version" they're building at Taipingling now should be seen as 3G.
1460421725779202053 2021-11-16 01:37:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BrunoVuan I'm hoping to see a nuclear power development timeline for the decades before 2060 the national 14th FYP. So far we only have provincial FYPs...
1460421173871742979 2021-11-16 01:35:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BrunoVuan Certainly the CAP1400 will have a role to play as well, but SPIC won't be able to build any more CAP1400s until the first two demo plants in Shidaowan are fully operational...while HPR1000 is ready for mass deployment *now*.

But if you think that's the defining characteristic to present, that you occasionally weren't granted the outrageous privilege that follows you everywhere else in China, you're either being disingenous or you're just a weeny...lol
1460191555667390466 2021-11-15 10:22:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy It's a common phase for Chinese-learning foreigners. You get like 3-4 years in, start to think you have a solid handle on things, start trying to educate Chinese people about things, offering your hot takes to the world.  Many China Watchers never leave that phase.
1460191039709270018 2021-11-15 10:20:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy I recognize this attitude learly because I wasn't so different in ~2013.  I was vulnerable to the exact biases and arrogance and smug confidence that you see here. And if I had gone back to the US after, I might have ended up just as ignorant.  8 years later, I'm glad I didn't.
1460189940457766913 2021-11-15 10:16:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy Looks like a white dude expat, to be complaining about China doing a racism to him.

1460178647772397571 2021-11-15 09:31:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @A_Person_hi WEC transferred the design and part of the IP to SNPTC (now part of SPIC).  SPIC and CNNC will still build several more AP1000s, but the technology that will be favored more in the future will be the Chinese indigenous technology.

1460177714808180736 2021-11-15 09:27:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy The official name of the '79 border war is the "Sino-Vietnamese War of Self-defense and Counterattack". So very much yes.

1460077388595822595 2021-11-15 02:49:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the intervening years, the AP1000 has lost significant favor with industry stakeholders, while the HPR1000's star has been rising. That's why I expect most of these designs will be switched over to HPR1000.   (Much as Sanmen Unit 5/6 have, despite 1-4 being AP1000s).
1460076726558494725 2021-11-15 02:46:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Inland plants were basically frozen after Fukushima.

È¶ñÊ¨°‰∏¥Áïå  This means fission reactions in the fuel core have been allowed to begin.  Next major milestone will be grid connection.   https://t.co/05pnu2EShM

1459807397388505089 2021-11-14 08:56:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed I've been hearing from friends in SZ that a lot of places arent checking codes right now, so maybe it won't be much of a hassle
1459803574188216321 2021-11-14 08:41:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HarveyZZed We also have a 3rd week at home, not quarantine, but "home monitoring" ÔºàÂ±ÖÂÆ∂ÁõëÊµãÔºâ  You can go out, but not to public places with a lot of people like malls. I assume this will be implemented via an orange QR code, something like that.
1459770592983339009 2021-11-14 06:30:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW this quarantine entry scheme is completely unnavigable unless you speak AND read Chinese - documents, mini-apps, phone calls, everything.  It's not a problem for me, but err...doesn't SZ kinda aspire to be seen as an int'l city?  Or is this some kind of selection filter? üòõ
1459768615662600193 2021-11-14 06:22:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The policy since Aug, by the way, says I can apply for my second week of quarantine to be at home if I'm returning to SZ from HK (which has its own quarantine, and no cases ~6 months).  PLEASE don't make a rule without guidelines and then hand execution over to Á§æÂå∫Âäû. üôÑ
1459768607995428867 2021-11-14 06:22:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A. Well you have someone else living at home B. Yes, that's no problem, she can stay in a hotel for a week A. Ahh...no. You can't quarantine at home. I'm hanging up. *hangs up*.  Love it. Three straght lies followed by the flat denial with nothing to back it up. ü§°üí©
1459768598738604032 2021-11-14 06:22:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The local community service office Á§æÂå∫Âäû is generally  packed with sinecurists &amp; volunteers. They are not known for efficiency/proactivity.  Unfortunately SZ gov't put them in charge of determining if I can do my second week of quarantine at home.  And they really don't want it:

1459367258958942209 2021-11-13 03:47:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 We even talk the same. I grew up around "ho-lay boyz" and "chere" and "jeezum rice" and "tabarnac" on my side of the border too.
1459366691586994176 2021-11-13 03:45:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Well they needed a lot more economic benefit to rationally balance out the emotional response and they didn't get it. Local politics is a tricky thing and it seems they really screwed this one up...  And yes Mainers (esp. in the north where I'm from) are identical to Canadians ha
1459363948449333249 2021-11-13 03:34:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 A quote from a state rep that sums up the sentiment well:üôÉ  "I have strongly opposed the CMP Corridor because I am concerned about what we are giving up, all for 38 permanent jobs.

1459363220376883201 2021-11-13 03:31:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FrancoisOuell15 Oh I know, but if the people who are selling and buying the power are "those fucking Canadians" and "those fucking Massholes", respectively, they'd better be offering something really attractive to the people in the middle. We're very tribal up there...
1459359085002850305 2021-11-13 03:14:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As someone from Maine, who spoke to family and friends on this project:  The primary point I heard was that no one felt the project owners could convincingly explain how this would bring any benefit to Maine. That it was just tearing up the wilderness to bring power to Massholes.
1459220098435088387 2021-11-12 18:02:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mfceli it's about the same price as what you'd pay for a lunch on the high speed rail. For what it is, yeah it's a little expensive. The meal combo is 100 for the day, includes three meals, total 20+40+40.
1459185258025209858 2021-11-12 15:44:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wenbecn @AKgnewsbee I have a case of water I'm using to do bicep curls and shoulder press.  Then I can do situps, pushups, dips, planks, squats in the room. Lots of bodyweight stuff.
1459180226580156420 2021-11-12 15:24:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wenbecn @AKgnewsbee Yeah you can also make parcel orders. But no fridge in the room, so I can't order anything edible unless it's dry goods.
1459179219838111747 2021-11-12 15:20:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wenbecn @AKgnewsbee Honestly I probably won't order the hotel's package again...I will order delivery tomorrow. I would like more greens and protein, less carbs.

1459129936162136065 2021-11-12 12:04:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Sun42John Lol I was pretty surprised. I've only had a starfruit once or twice, cut into pieces already. I was pretty confused looking at it at first, then I was like hmmm I think it's starfruit?
1459121314191470592 2021-11-12 11:30:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cagebird9724 Can't order alcohol. Although my luggage wasn't searched or anything when I arrived, so I guess I could have brought some in.

1459029981317632000 2021-11-12 05:27:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sadly not allowed to order BBQ skewers...probably because the wooden skewers are too sharp? Self-harm risk I suppose? Anyway BBQ is listed in there along with cigarettes, alcohol, and sharp/dangerous objectives as verboten delivery items.
1459029428957290497 2021-11-12 05:24:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Day 2 hotel quarantine lunch.  Stewed beef with radish, braised winter melon, stir-fried pork with peppers, and a seaweed/pork broth soup. Tastes alright, nothing special.  Total: 40CNY (a bit over 6 USD).  I'm also able to order delivery, and I probably will. Just curious today.  https://t.co/aFi7Qe9DJI
1459023497426989057 2021-11-12 05:01:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AKgnewsbee Nope, just the specific meals in the daily set. If you have dietary restrictions or something like that I assume you can tell them, but otherwise you get what's served.
1459023331936509956 2021-11-12 05:00:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DiddlySquat51 Yeah 14+7 at home. If you're coming from HK specifically, there's also a scheme where you can apply to do the second 7 days at your home as well, which I have applied for. We'll see...

1457298724514766859 2021-11-07 10:47:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway this concludes my hiking tour of HK's generation assets. Although technically I guess I should go visit Daya Bay NPP now, since most of its power is used in HK.   There's no near-site hiking, but I could probably swing a site tour. Stay tuned...
1457298721918500864 2021-11-07 10:47:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For instance, there are these HV lines that run from these plants east to west across the Kowloon Hills to eastern Kowloon and NT.  If you hike Lion's Rock on the Maclehose Trail Sec. 5, like I did last weekend, you'll pass directly under one of the HV towers.  https://t.co/mgLVFe2AYd
1457298674405363715 2021-11-07 10:47:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These two thermal power plants, along with the 75% output of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant which CLP owns 25% of (in Shenzhen) comprise the bulk of the power consumed by power users in Kowloon and New Territories, which is CLP's service area.   HV lines connect to the city.
1457298672132128772 2021-11-07 10:47:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And slightly to the north is Black Point, its smokestacks barely visible behind the mountain. There may be a better trail to get more visibility, but the sun wasn't going to last for long and I didn't want to be stuck going down an unfamiliar mountain in the dark....  https://t.co/V38limIvc5
1457298637923385348 2021-11-07 10:47:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I saved this hike for last for good reason. Castle Peak is considered one of the toughest climbs in HK. It's quite steep...More like scaling a mountain than actually hiking. But you get great views of Tuen Mun village, SZ Bay, Lantau Island, and Shekou in Shenzhen.  Smoggy day...  https://t.co/P2cs8WGnnR
1457298605023240192 2021-11-07 10:47:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> My last weekend in Hong Kong! And my last hike...  Of course I had to complete the task I gave myself when I arrived 7 weeks ago: hike and photograph every utility power generation asset in Hong Kong.   Which means I had to climb Castle Peak in New Territories.  https://t.co/UwS7uZsUU8

1456933978766643205 2021-11-06 10:38:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MyChinaTrip @allencharp I've heard of some people doing this. Rent or buy in SZ, especially next to the Suzhou Industrial Park rail station, work in SH.
1456881841160404997 2021-11-06 07:11:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Oh yeah very much so. And I was happy to give quotes to just about anyone at the time. I had juicy details that were in high demand.   But if big news like that happens again... I'm gonna be pickier about who gets access. Have to have a bottom line...as unimportant as I am.

Just a weird situation for me this time.
1456864728043507714 2021-11-06 06:03:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LesBlazemore @NickGiva @GabrielCorsetti @StephenMcDonell I was on a different kind of visa before and it was expiring without enough time for me to go through the bureaucratic paperwork for me to switch over to a work visa, so I had to leave quickly to avoid overstaying. It was my fault/pandemic weirdness.
1456855390730153986 2021-11-06 05:26:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nice.  https://t.co/ibiQ6DeFlN

1456565691272761345 2021-11-05 10:14:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @williamsantosg3 Yeah I saw that news too. So clearly they're getting their stocks back up, just hard to know what they've paid for the coal now in their warehouses.  Are these new contracts or old contracts with revised terms? CCTD says new annual contracts for 5500 kcal are going for 843/mt
1456559210355822593 2021-11-05 09:49:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Today, let us hear the tale of the day r/wallstreetbets discovered the Zhengzhou commodities exchange.
1456558745207468032 2021-11-05 09:47:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @williamsantosg3 In normal periods it's 70% long-term vs. 30% shorter/spot. Obviously varies by plant but that's good rule of thumb.  Right now...I have no idea. Obviously harder to sign long-term contracts at the moment.
1456557543862325251 2021-11-05 09:42:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Well if you were dumb enough to ape into coal futures in mid October thinking the gov't wasn't going intervene, ...you got exactly what you deserved. üí©
1456554123277443084 2021-11-05 09:28:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Yeah it's swung around a corner and spot is now around 1200/1300. So basically like the level on the blue curve that corresponds with...early September-ish.

1456527351144087556 2021-11-05 07:42:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW:  If coal generators can find buyers in the spot market (which have NO price cap), then they can still cover those high costs. Here's spot trades from Monday: Over .80 RMB/kWh. Someone is buying at these prices.  (Need to divide by 1000 because this chart is MWh, not kWh).  https://t.co/HlBQ1LjWFM
1456524219446022146 2021-11-05 07:30:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DrKinKam It's even more confusing that there's multiple COPs.  This was the 26th meeting of the COP on Climate Change but a few weeks ago was the 15th meeting of the COP on Biodiversity.  So it was COP15, followed by COP26...lol
1456520398346981379 2021-11-05 07:14:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This sample chart was generated by our in-house SMRC/LRMC coal on-grid tariff model using simplified inputs.  If we were running the model for a customer, of course we'd assume some blended basket of long-, medium- and short-term coal contracts.
1456520395918508038 2021-11-05 07:14:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course this chart is oversimplified; it assumes ALL coal used by coal plants is purchased at the spot price, which is not the case.  But it clearly shows how coal prices affect generation costs and profit margins.  At 1000 CNY/tonne, *spot coal is still unprofitable.*
1456520392932147203 2021-11-05 07:14:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Understand China 2021 power pricing in one chart!  Horizontal green line = base rate coal-fired generators can earn for power in Shandong.  Green dotted line =  NEW +20% higher rate generators can earn for power.  Blue curve = generation cost of coal fired power.  See a problem?  https://t.co/MTBH8zER2c

1456238647288549385 2021-11-04 12:35:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg SZ started cleaning up everyone who wasn't on a proper M or Z visa a few months ago.

You have been summoned, then you'll have a chance to either offer an excuse to not serve as a juror or do your best to make sure you aren't selected.

1455888675003269125 2021-11-03 13:24:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero Oh you mean the cost of power associated with mining and washing coal.  Mostly coal miners produce their own power onsite via captive coal power plants, especially for coal washing. They supply their own coal, so their power is very cheap.
1455884638723854339 2021-11-03 13:08:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @LHongqiao Yeah I noticed there were no interviewee comments or quotes on that portion of the article.  I wonder if they could have found anyone to provide context or commentary on the NDRC talking points.  *cough*

1455872005354373120 2021-11-03 12:18:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra It's not really a long-term issue here. More like a  short-term phenomenon associated with the new reforms and general coal volatility.  Industrial power users finding it quite annoying - generators have power to sell but refuse to commit to any long term pricing contract.
1455866120825495557 2021-11-03 11:55:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Besides inexperience of course, is the fact that no one has any confidence AT ALL about where coal prices will be in the spring/summer of next year.  And the price of coal-fired power is still the reference point for other types of power.
1455864632187424768 2021-11-03 11:49:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Suspect the main factor for this is general inexperience with forecasting power prices in the open markets.  They don't want to leave money on the table, so they refuse to lock into long-term contracts that they can't revise later.  Lotta lawyers making money right now.
1455863514900299776 2021-11-03 11:44:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting situation emerging. Seems it's getting quite hard to contract for power supply in China right now, not for lack of supply, but because generators are hedging.  Customers are desperate for long-term fixed price power purchase contracts, but generators won't offer them.

1455783298135838720 2021-11-03 06:26:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MyChinaTrip Wuhu has to be one of the smallest cities if not the smallest city in China to get a metro. Or maybe Kunshan.

1455204103324270598 2021-11-01 16:04:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's a difficult and sensitive topic that IMO China still handles exceedingly poorly, on both societal response and medical treatment levels.  It's getting better, certainly, but there's still so, so far to go.  Props to @realsteelmuslim for talking about it at all.
1455204101906599946 2021-11-01 16:04:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the stigma from family and friends is severe, about having a mental illness about taking drugs to treat it, everything.   Well-meaning advice is rooted in ignorance. It's even worse for women, where the well-meaning advice for mental health will often come layered in sexism.
1455204100350492673 2021-11-01 16:04:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Often the only option for compassionate and qualified mental health treatment in China, even in large cities, is international clinics, which are prohibitively expensive for most people. Hard to be taken seriously otherwise.  Speaking from personal experience with a loved one.
1455071771116261377 2021-11-01 07:18:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For reference here's a screenshot of mine-mouth prices today of the three major domestic coal indices.

Has been the case for nearly 2 years now.  There's whole trope about Westerners musing over whether Xi/the Party is 'feeling insecure' and the answer is always no.

1454429105433178113 2021-10-30 12:44:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Can't help but notice how many Twitter experts on climate change have suddenly emerged in the run-up to COP26.  Even experts on the very specialized field of China and climate change!  Especially experts on China and climate change!    Amazing stuff.
1454426636535746561 2021-10-30 12:35:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh Honestly I'm the only person I ever knew in the US who had one. I don't even think they're common in college towns.
1454425176938934280 2021-10-30 12:29:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yangliuxh I had one in college. A great choice for a student with no budget to spend on gassing up a car.

1454355863452356608 2021-10-30 07:53:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome @phl43 This is pathetic. @ChinaPowerCSIS @TheEconomist    You're transparently flailing at this point.  China's a place wehre humans have friends, coworkers and families. WHERE exactly do you think we managed to conceal 600k respiratory-illness deaths from a virulently contagious virus?
1454323431093145601 2021-10-30 05:45:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 @KeithBradsher Yes absolutely
1454314836276305922 2021-10-30 05:10:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 @KeithBradsher Yeah, as I said in my first comment above. The journo does decent work in Shanghai, the editor in NYC chooses some poor headline that undermines the good reporting.  A lot of people just scan headlines.
1454311921511923712 2021-10-30 04:59:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Imran1759 @KeithBradsher China's climate goals are not at risk. It's a non-sequitur. There's been no revision to the 2025 coal peak or 2030 carbon goals or timelines as a result of this coal pricing crisis
1454311270878908419 2021-10-30 04:56:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @struth1ocamelus @KeithBradsher Perhaps you should consult someone with a background in energy, climate science, or international trade. Someone from one of those disciplines might have a more relevant perspective on cumulative emissions, per capita emissions, or exported emissions.
1454278398503632901 2021-10-30 02:46:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KeithBradsher Anyway this quote from AIIB president Jin Liqun should have been the key takeaway/framing device for the whole article IMO.  It's a short-term correction of an overshot in attempting to limit coal, i.e. overdoing the carbon reduction effort and then being forced to walk it back.  https://t.co/dYEEw56qPB
1454276522802511876 2021-10-30 02:38:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jamie_Freed @KeithBradsher Australia doesn't have the world's monopoly on 6000 kcal coal.  The handful of coastal plants that were using Oz anthracite have replaced it long ago (remember it was like 2% of Chinese coal usage).  I'm begging you all to stop mentioning Oz coal.
1454274799342014468 2021-10-30 02:31:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KeithBradsher Keith, I can tell you put effort into putting together an nuanced story about the role of coal. But this headline has basically nothing to do with the contents of the article. It's a shame.  You're being undermined by the editor here (geddit? 'undermined' on coal story? ha.)

1453212642919817224 2021-10-27 04:11:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SecondRingSZN Well I too used to take it personally when Chinese people didn't respect my 'knowledge' or gatekept me from things. We all have egos.  But that was insecurity based in not actually knowing much. Now I'm over it, cause I know what I'm talking about. And I shut up when I don't.

1452612010814803971 2021-10-25 12:24:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To be clear, this is focused on Chinese food in HK.  I have little experience with/opinions to share on Western food in HK. I eat it infrequently and when I do, I seek out comfort food, not fine dining.

1452594731863592960 2021-10-25 11:15:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @likeimonfire There's almost no real mainland food in HK, so it's a hard comparison. They have food that they call mainland food, but it's just HK versions of things.  Good western food in HK though, although usually stupidly expensive.  Also better Indian, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese.
1452594023479185409 2021-10-25 11:12:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thestevecarton I plan to just cross back into Shenzhen if they'll let me (I'll have SH work permit, so not sure if they'll require me to go there directly). And then I'll just accept whatever I get. SZ has a 7+7+7 scheme so I'll be angling for that.   https://t.co/S8IPSkpHnQ
1452593005286752259 2021-10-25 11:08:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chrispydog @AngelicaOung Well it's light stuff that goes out publically. It's not like the old days. The phrasing is like:  "we must rectify the blind pursuit of energy consumption objectives...curb the inappropriate measures applied in those efforts"  Blind, inappropriate, those qualify as harsh words.
1452590693570940931 2021-10-25 10:59:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chrispydog @AngelicaOung There's been a decent amount of humble pie eating in energy-sector documents and regulations in the last few weeks. I mean it's all couched in Party-speak so you have to look carefully for the self-criticism but it's in there for sure. Sector planners know they effed up.
1452588866901196800 2021-10-25 10:52:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chrispydog @AngelicaOung Both centrally planned and fully marketized power sectors would have dealt with an impending coal shortage more effectively than what we saw.  So it's a bit of a strawman to describe this as a failure of a centrally planned power sector IMO. China's was already half-liberalized.

1452576839231152128 2021-10-25 10:04:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When I go back to mainland, I'm going to have a quarantine of 14-21 days.  I will use that time to focus and write about important developments in China energy.  But I will also find time to pen a scathing indictment of the HK culinary scene. Anyone want to publish my rant? üò°
1452567561720066048 2021-10-25 09:27:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Major outcome from all of this has been to kickstart power sector reforms - making the problems that led to this situation difficult to repeat, and ultimately good for China's decarbonization efforts, and by extension, all of us who like to breathe air. üòâ
1452566745068146694 2021-10-25 09:24:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung We ofc have different editorial tones, so won't comment there...üòú  Good summary of the underlying drivers for the power crisis and the resultant disuptions to supply chains. A few details I could quibble over, but nothing egregious.  Takeaway could be more uplifting though IMO
1452534545677361158 2021-10-25 07:16:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DrKinKam @myjoan_joan I don't think the account itself is now sus or anything, but refusing to delete the bad post shows a concerning lack of integrity.

1452521889943801857 2021-10-25 06:26:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I wonder what % of the high intensity, high emission industries were exporting vs. consumed domestically. Curious how this one will play out on the ground...
1452517872639508486 2021-10-25 06:10:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonwakter @AngelicaOung Hmm that is weird.  I feel like he's singlehandedly showing that Chinese media workers on social media don't have to be big-mouthed asshats... He's certainly making a better representation than, e.g. Chen or Hu, although he gets sarcastic sometimes.
1452515920845312002 2021-10-25 06:02:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung @simonwakter But also I wouldn't want to encourage the idea that reporting in China can be done from HK. In that regard it's definitely not potato potahto. It's really a bubble here and very different.   Obviously China denying J visa renewals doesn't help.. sigh.
1452512135326494720 2021-10-25 05:47:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @simonwakter @AngelicaOung I challenge you or anyone to find any issues with ZIchen's reporting

Since its very existence as a phrase seems geared toward avoiding having to use ethnically-delimited group names in the first place.
1451481659857989632 2021-10-22 09:32:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mikeygow @Hubei_Peasant We can agree that '‰∏≠ÂçéÊ∞ëÊóè'means whatever it needs to mean for its users.  I think its users in China use it preceisely *for* its vagueness and implied inclusivity. That ‰∏≠ÂçéÊ∞ëÊóè-ness is (and must be) broad enough to include all peoples tied together by China's geography.

1451463603882631169 2021-10-22 08:21:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @mikeygow The quiet (and sometimes not so quiet) implication is usually that native Chinese concepts on these topics are backward of course.  The West developed these theories over the past few decades and then in typical evangelical fashion decided it applied to the whole damn world.
1451460824388685828 2021-10-22 08:10:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @mikeygow This is what you get when you try to shoehorn Chinese context into Western social theories.  That's the farthest Western humanities researchers ever get in China: thorough knowledge of facts, and yet missing what they mean, because they can only look at it from Western lens.
1451447072268242947 2021-10-22 07:15:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Hm so maybe it's too optimistic to say the coal price controls would "return generators to profitability".  It's more like "return generators to tolerable levels of losses".
1451440316318318597 2021-10-22 06:48:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Yes, if they buy *exclusively* at spot, it should still be impossible to turn a profit. I have to assume spot is being used as the basis for (lower priced) wholesale contracts.  For instance, CNCG here reports supplying 57000 tonnes to a power plant in Liaoning at 1200 CNY/tonne.  https://t.co/ZoeZBQgsLN
1451435091616403457 2021-10-22 06:27:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Addendum: sxcoal reporting the first negative price movement we've seen for domestic 5500 thermal coal in weeks: Datong 5500 (Inner Mongolia) mine-mouth price is DOWN 5.4% versus yesterday!   https://t.co/hUc6x0ulVS
1451434044017627139 2021-10-22 06:23:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Conclusion: All the stops are being pulled (both market and policy intervention) out to ensure domestic coal supply. Ship is turning.  1800 CNY/tonne is not arbitary; I guess this is calc'ed to be the max level at which coal generators can cover costs with the new +20% tariffs.
1451434041773674498 2021-10-22 06:23:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Third, according to industry media, the measures to increase domestic coal production are also starting to take effect.  China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association reports Chinese daily coal production in the first half of October is up 4.5% versus September.  https://t.co/RW9RviOcWG
1451434037390680070 2021-10-22 06:23:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Next : Seems like 1800 CNY/tonne is the magic number.  4 major Chinese coal producers including heavyweights CHN and CNCG have now made statements that they'll cap 5500 kcal at 1800 CNY/tonne through the winter/spring to ensure stable-price heating supply.  https://t.co/26Lj7ATVgJ
1451434034848952320 2021-10-22 06:23:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4-part update on Chinese coal for today:   First: Coal futures in the Zhengzhou CX are *down* for the first time in weeks. No doubt thanks to NDRC intervention announced a few days ago.  They hit a record high of 1982 CNY/tonne on Tu, fell 8% on Wed, now down to 1364 (Fri).  https://t.co/PG8V4Sv43n

Texas had severe weather but was also very exposed to that kind of thing because it's an island grid. Different phenomenon.   Power supply fails for different reasons everywhere.
1451140686338682883 2021-10-21 10:57:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @acosgrove003 No problem. Think I'll make a screenshot of this exchange for the next time I bump into someone from BNEF üòú
1451138935447429137 2021-10-21 10:50:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @acosgrove003 It's veryy close to the trading price of coal-fired power in those provinces rn, due to the overall power scarcity.   So that's the respective provincial base coal-fired price + 20%.  e.g. Guangdong is 0.453 * 1.20  = 0.5436 CNY/kWh.  Plus T&amp;D fees (on the buyer end).
1451123520507809795 2021-10-21 09:49:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> ESPECIALLY if you had a subsidy-earning project where your govt subsidy payout was delayed and disbursed over 20 years.  Wholesale market settlement is available here and now.  2-3% subsidy rate over 20 years? vs. 20% wholesale contract rate for 3 years  No brainer.
1451122719639048200 2021-10-21 09:46:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hell, I'll even go further back.  RE contracts for next year are currently available in Jiangsu Power Exchange at nearly the same level as the currently (very expensive) coal-fired power.  At that price, projects going back as far as 2018, 2017 might give up their subsidies!
1451119044023635972 2021-10-21 09:31:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Hearing from contacts that renewable energy contracts for 2022 are already SOLD OUT in Guangdong and nearly sold out for Jiangsu (and what's left is very expensive).  Power consumers scrambling to secure reliable power supply for next year are voting with their wallets.

1450685845854298115 2021-10-20 04:50:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I got asked a question about this last night as well from US media. Let me address future questions in advance:  Xi hasn't left China in nearly two years, apparently because of the global pandemic. It's disingenuous to frame inattendence of COP26 as a snub. Stop asking.

1450682661756833798 2021-10-20 04:37:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As China implements its power sector reforms, it appears to be handing some of the responsibility to power consumers, counting on the fact that they will choose renewable energy as long as it's reasonably affordable.  They can't create demand, but can tilt the playing field.
1450680493611970562 2021-10-20 04:29:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta I've started telling people that the best way for foreign countries to "engage" with China energy planning is for MNCs with factories in China to demand renewable energy and be willing to pay more for it. Certainly has more practical outcomes than political finger wagging.

Futures haven't turned the corner yet either.    From today, looks like we're about to see more direct policy intervention soon to stabilize coal prices:   https://t.co/BL0hLhhov4
1450490235599556618 2021-10-19 15:53:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham Many of them were losing money all year and just ate it. And then with the sudden coal price spike in Stepember, the small losses went to big losses. So now they're back to small losses again. Hard to estimate for a whole industry though. We do coal LRMC on a plant basis.
1450489425599754242 2021-10-19 15:50:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham Yeah, but they appear to be willing to accept whatever margin they're getting, because the generators are submitting bids into the wholesale market again. Maybe they're mildly profitable...maybe just breaking even, or maybe they're back to some 'acceptable' level of losses...
1450488031039746053 2021-10-19 15:44:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @craig_botham You're referring to shortages of power because generators were refusing to operate their plants at a loss?  They have had their allowed on-grid tariff rate raised. So now they can afford to operate again, even with the still very expensive coal.

1450082850682785793 2021-10-18 12:54:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlexGabuev Probably most interesting part for gas is the part about setting up a capacity market, since that's where gas theoretically finds its home in the future.  I don't know much about gas plants in China though - how they normally dispatch, their on-grid rate, etc. Not my area üôÇ
1450073208686739470 2021-10-18 12:16:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jwickers We've had SOE generators operating at a loss for months now. Show me the Chinese private power producer or MNC power developer that would have accepted that lol.

1450071377508122627 2021-10-18 12:08:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have to disagree. Deregulation is good, but non-state owned players would not have helped. They're way less tolerant of losses than SOEs.   Also, they are free to partipate in the generation sector right now. They don't much, for a variety of reasons, but are certainly able to.

Raising power costs by 50% is probably impossible for most. It's basically a de facto ban on energy intensive industries using any power, given current prices.

1449991566051799046 2021-10-18 06:51:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A key thing about Twitter is that while it can be (very) toxic, it's large enough so that there's a community of expertise for everything, including nuclear.  You bring poor arguments that work for genpop, eventually you're going to be debunked by people with sectoral expertise.
1449963604321521667 2021-10-18 05:00:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For context, China's domestic thermal coal price benchmark for several years had been 535 CNY/tonne, with a stoplight system that was supposed to kick into place to increase or decrease supply when prices deviated too far from that benchmark.
1449960047967039492 2021-10-18 04:46:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This will only be resolved by expanding coal supply. That means digging more out of the ground.  China has approved capacity expansion in 153 domestic mines as of last week. This coal will take weeks to months to affect markets (time for mining, washing, transport). Oof.
1449960045983109122 2021-10-18 04:46:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So, while coal plant inventories are generally back up around the 2-week mark (they had dipped to just 2-3 days for some plants previously) and power is certainly going to be more stable, it's also going to be more expensive for a good while.  Power users need to be prepared.
1449960043512614914 2021-10-18 04:46:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With these prices, the recent +20% on-grid rate hike is not enough for generators to be profitable.  A short analysis in a BJX article on Friday showed that at 1752 CNY/tonne, even the most efficient plant in China (Waigaoqiao Unit 3) is losing money.   https://t.co/fmye8jax7Y  https://t.co/KTxs2HBouC

1449224628132454400 2021-10-16 04:04:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We'll check in again at 6969 obviously.
1448980003505401857 2021-10-15 11:52:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ausmschneider The reg. just directly says all coal generation has to be sold via the open markets.  The quota guaranteed a plant XXXX annual offtake hours hours, to be purchased by the grid. They didn't actually have a proper capacity market (although they're now exploring setting one up).
1448978214991253510 2021-10-15 11:45:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CarterPaddy Or rather *the ancillary services market was opened to storage*.  Ordinarily I'd have done a whole thread and analysis on that one alone, but there's just been SO much news on tariff reform and shortages that I've had no time to talk about storage policy...
1448977693270106116 2021-10-15 11:42:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CarterPaddy They don't really have an option about building storage or not. Newbuild solar/wind paired with storage is mandated across the country now.  Storage was opened up to the ancillary services market last week. Everything's happening at once...   https://t.co/P3TxsnQei6

1448945590113484802 2021-10-15 09:35:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To conclude the piece, I also explore a few forward-looking (fairly wonky) questions that will be of interest to sector nerds. Feel free to review those on your own.   What will happen next year, or in 3-5 years, is all very speculative. But it's going to be exciting! ü§ì
1448945587106189313 2021-10-15 09:35:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few years ago, that would have been to the detriment of renewables. Liberalizing the markets would have have made it hard for them to compete versus coal.  These days, generation costs are such that liberalization is good news for decarbonization. Renewables are often cheaper.  https://t.co/1qIjLoflI4
1448945575781494785 2021-10-15 09:35:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China's reforms create the conditions whereby power consumers will exert market pressure for developers to build more of certain types of power. They want inexpensive, reliable power, of course, so that will be built.  Expensive or unreliable power drops out of the system.
1448945573449453568 2021-10-15 09:35:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to that conceptual image above, you can see that any capacity with marginal cost above the demand curve would not be dispatched.  For example, if demand is at the Q1 level, gas power would not be dispatched onto the grid.  This forces excess/inefficient generators out.
1448945570781929478 2021-10-15 09:35:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In a true power market, something called a "dispatch merit order" emerges.  Basically the cheapest marginal power gets dispatched first, then the next cheapest, and so on, until demand at that moment is met.  Conceptually looks like this: (Source:  https://t.co/zV0aIxyIQ5)  https://t.co/fWtUGf2q1e
1448945566306619397 2021-10-15 09:35:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For a power system that previously guaranteed coal generators revenue just for being there, and ensured that power consumers never had to worry about the true cost of the power they consumed, this is BIG progress.  What we have now is an actual market (albeit with guardrails).
1448945561210540042 2021-10-15 09:35:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But this measure becomes much more meaningful when considered together with the 1st and 3rd reform items.  #1 means coal power must sell ALL its power into the wholesale markets. No more guaranteed offtake hours just for existing.   https://t.co/XbbeAlK85V
1448945558140317697 2021-10-15 09:35:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Already, we're seen monthly trading  in Jiangsu with the new float range, basically going right up to the +20% cap. And power consumers are still buying it.  Maybe they can't accept 20% higher prices over the long term, but they have no choice right now.   https://t.co/fcON3cIdwM
1448945555195895809 2021-10-15 09:35:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you've been following the power story from me or others, you know the 2nd item is about addressing the shortages caused by expensive coal, allowing coal-fired generators to continue operating by selling power at a higher price in the wholesale markets.   https://t.co/5KnSuWYQPH
1448945552759001090 2021-10-15 09:35:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The three key reforms have been covered by others already, but to recap:   1. Coal-fired power must sell 100% of its power to wholesale markets 2. Wholesale market trading cap raised to 20% above baseline 3. All commercial and industrial power users must buy in open markets.
1448945550397640706 2021-10-15 09:35:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, these reforms are a huge deal. I know they've been kind of swallowed by the bigger story of the power shortages, (understandably) but in the context of sector reform, these go way beyond easing shortages.  Safe to say the shortages definitely accelerated the reforms tho.

1448657484168630283 2021-10-14 14:30:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 I basically never encountered trad in SH except the occasional KTV. Pops up a lot more in SZ, due to HK proximity I assume.  I definitely don't read it nearly as fluidly as simp but I've also made zero effort. My gf has an MA and is about the same so I don't feel bad lol.
1448648577102667794 2021-10-14 13:55:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 If you're making an effort yeah. I feel both sides err towards more confidence about their reading skills for the opposite character set in theory than reality though.
1448641291902881793 2021-10-14 13:26:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wokeglobaltimes Hummm, I actually went Googling for "regular script" just in case there was a usage I didn't know, and couldn't find any issues other than the one I knew. Yeah definitely haven't heard that phrasing before either...
1448628887009693698 2021-10-14 12:36:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8. For most everyone else, you're most likely going only learn one character set.   And you're FAR more statistically likely to be meeting and using it to communicate with people from the PRC.   So you'd better go simplified.
1448628884790931458 2021-10-14 12:36:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7. If you love trad characters and you want them to be preserved and cherished, that's great.  But no nonsense about them being better "over the long run".  That's pretty much only true if you're pursuing a career in academia/journalism/punditry and you're gonna learn both.
1448628882492432387 2021-10-14 12:36:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. For most everyone else, if you can only do one, simplified is more practical.  For students who choose to take Chinese at Harvard because it's 2021 and China is an important world superpower and they want to be relevant in the job market, they should be learning simplified.
1448628879908691976 2021-10-14 12:36:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. BUT, here are the scenarios where you might want to *only* learn trad:  - You plan to live in HK/TW, and never read/write Chinese with people from PRC, SG, MY. - You're really into old gov't documents - loooove Cantopop at KTV  (Academics need both btw)
1448628877543165955 2021-10-14 12:36:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. So, if you can only learn one, or you think you'll only time/energy/resouces to learn one, then ask yourself: why are you learning Chinese? What's your long-term motivation or goal with this language?  For most people, that answer should lead you to simplified characters.
1448628875089432577 2021-10-14 12:36:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Which is of course the point about why the characters were simplified in the first place. They were harder for Chinese to learn just like they are harder for non-Chinese to learn.  Chinese literacy rate rose from 20%-68% over 1950-1982, *in part* thanks to the "PRC script".
1448628872811925504 2021-10-14 12:36:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. If you have the chance to learn both, learn both! Of course it's best to know both.  I think it's easier to go from trad to simplified than the other way around. But it also means a much steeper learning curve at the beginning, and Chinese already inspires a lot of burnout.
1448628870068924417 2021-10-14 12:36:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On this...  1. The proper definition of 'regular script' Ê•∑‰π¶ encompasses both simplified and traditional. But I know it's not what he meant, cuz it was some chauvinistic play to define trad as 'regular', as if simplified are...irregular? üôÑ  2. PRC, SG, MY all use simplified BTW
1448557046245191683 2021-10-14 07:51:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RobbieBarwick If you always take the opposite position from Drew, you'll be on the right side of history far more often than not, without even knowing the issue. He's just consistent like that. üòâ

Coal's role and image as a reliable firm supply after this pricing crisis has been really shaken and I think nuclear will be expected to step into that position, post 2025 when the coal plants aren't to be built anymore...

Perhaps not...but they're really going to try. Now that Hualong One is really for NOAK deployment, it will be a lot faster.  And the larger CAP1400s will make the annual 10GW goal easier to meet too.
1447884798551232513 2021-10-12 11:20:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TuukkaMard @juheja @teinij @AtteHarjanne They'll struggle to ramp up the construction pace for the first few years I think. The 2020 goal was missed by a few GW, after it had already been adjusted downward. But that was due to the switch to a Hualong One-based fleet, instead of the AP1000s....

1447121305665294337 2021-10-10 08:46:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And as a final point: it's very reasonable/likely to find a statistically significant slowdown of wind speeds *this year*.  It's the attempt to link it to a decade-old, basically already-reversed phenomenon where this article seems to have lost the plot.
1447120703988252674 2021-10-10 08:43:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> tl;dr: Media reports breathlessly reporting "climate change-induced decrease in wind speed" are repeating outdated hypotheses, not incorporating recent data/research.  Zeng et al. (2019) show INCREASING wind speeds over the last decade, possibly due to multi-decade ocean cycles.  https://t.co/z51h6MkOic
1447120699269607425 2021-10-10 08:43:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Seems like the FT article really went up the wrong tree here. What should our general takeaway as media consumers be?  Work on becoming more scientifically and statistically literate. Always keep a critical mind when you read popular media, ESPECIALLY for scientific articles.
1447120696409088003 2021-10-10 08:43:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So what's actually going on here?  The authors think it's related to multi-decade cycles in ocean atmospherics. They expect increase in wind speeds for another decade. There's a lot of words I don't understand, because I'm not a climate scientist, but their conclusion is clear:  https://t.co/XTpM4E6IFr
1447120690553884675 2021-10-10 08:43:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Indeed the authors surmise that the increase in North American wind production over the last decade, which had been attributed mostly to technology gains, may also be connected to this general increase in wind speeds.  https://t.co/qNlTpZ9zid
1447120684975489025 2021-10-10 08:43:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The authors find this increase to be statistically significant in all wind-producing regions, even as early as 2001, but most noticeable by 2010.  It is consistent across seasons and even after controlling for a number of data-gathering variables considered by the researchers.  https://t.co/C5q6BPkPs0
1447120679724216332 2021-10-10 08:43:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So we had a real phenomenon...significant slowdown in wind speeds from 1980-2010...that scientists couldn't agree how to explain.  Then around 2010, the phenomenon reversed itself and wind speeds around the world started INCREASING. 3x faster than they were declining before!  https://t.co/0d2zNGqSYl
1447120673692811264 2021-10-10 08:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Zeng et al. acknowledge the phenomenon of global stilling from 1980-2010 and point out that the potential explanations for such a slowdown in wind speeds were "contested".  https://t.co/KbsRYHPybD
1447120668668039175 2021-10-10 08:43:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here we have a 2019 paper by Zeng et al., published in Nature Climate Change, titled: „ÄäA reversal in global terrestrial stilling and its implications for wind energy production„Äã  (Full text, unformatted manuscript version here)  https://t.co/AVA5TNzvu8
1447120665807515648 2021-10-10 08:43:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well it seems...from around the early 2010s, wind speeds have been INCREASING around the world.  ...which is probably about the last time anyone bothered to update the Wikipedia page about "global terrestrial stilling".   Let's look at some more recent research...
1447120662510727169 2021-10-10 08:43:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is the first I hear of such a phenomenon...global stilling? Climate-change induced reduction of wind speeds? Sounds very alarming!   ...as long as you're only looking at research prior to 2010.  What do the most up-to-date data say anyway?  Thread...

If you refer to the CAP1400, it's incorrect to refer as such.  The CAP1400 is spec'ed at the 1400 MWe output level because that required major redesign constituting unique IP. That threshold was was considered in the AP1000 deal.
1446051300630695944 2021-10-07 09:54:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq !!!  This is a new feature on top of the explicitly regulated +10% trading price cap.  I wonder if any limits will be imposed on prices that may be charged via these "additional clauses". This will need to be further regulated in some way to protect power consumers.
1446044940987822085 2021-10-07 09:29:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra ...and that it can even be responsive and nimble.  The severe power cuts in Dongbei were just 10 days ago, and now we have new, explicit policy documents in Inner Mongolia that incorporate lessons learned from those events to make sure they can't happen again.
1446044235887616003 2021-10-07 09:26:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra Yeah, I like to share this kind of nerdy policy stuff.  Not because I think my followers are all soo interested in the Inner Mongolian power sector...but because I think it's important to remind the world that Chinese policy is not random, but full of carefully considered detail.
1446040249742757890 2021-10-07 09:10:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The doc also contains other information about which depts are responsible for execution, key terms, etc. It's even wonkier stuff...review it yourself.   Or you could contract w/ a crack team of China power consultants to help with your energy planning. Just saying. @LantauGroup
1446040247561637896 2021-10-07 09:10:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know overall there's a good bit of vagueness here that can hardly be reassuring for MNCs with exposure in Inner Mongolia.  IM has been among the more lightly-impacted regions so far, but seems they're definitely preparing a gameplan for more shortages, just in case.
1446040244961243140 2021-10-07 09:10:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Both the prioritized and restricted lists make reference to "other industries indicated by policy".  Take, for instance, production of mono-/polysilicon, which was previously a privileged industry for power trading, but has had that designation stripped away in other docs.  https://t.co/X7YRWXaJGf
1446040239428890627 2021-10-07 09:10:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I also note that coal production is designated as a protected industry.  I HAD heard rumors that various steps in the fuel coal supply chain were previously targeted for power curbing, themselves being high-consumption industries(!) A catch-22, but explicitly addressed here.
1446040237243654156 2021-10-07 09:10:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> While Inner Mongolia didn't score poorly on its 'dual control' report card for energy consumption and energy intensity, I note that they're still taking this opportunity to target any provincial enterprises that are out of alignment versus industry standards...
1446040235154964483 2021-10-07 09:10:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Generally captive coal plants tend to be smaller, older, less efficient coal plants. If you were using one to secure cheaper power for your (likely high-consuming, high-intensity) facility and now you'd like to switch over to grid power instead, the gov't is saying "no way".
1446040232529305601 2021-10-07 09:10:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few comments:   Nothing super unexpected here, mostly just things you'd expect by using logic.  I think the explicit targeting of industries w/ captive coal plants is interesting. Captive coal plants have long been a bane of regulators throughout China:   https://t.co/v5aes94wdp
1446040230331445253 2021-10-07 09:10:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. Any other high-consumption, high emission industries (e.g. chemicals...) 5. Enterprises whose power consumption per unit of production exeeds the industry benchmark for the region (note: this would be a reference to the 'energy intensity' portion of the dual-controls mandates)
1446040228091678721 2021-10-07 09:10:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. Any explicitly excluded/restricted industries by policy 2. Calcium carbide and ferroalloy (e.g. steel) industries (note: electric arc furnaces use INSANE amounts of energy) 3. Any industrial facility using a captive (i.e. self generation) thermal power plant
1446040225805864966 2021-10-07 09:10:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. Key National Projects, military industry 7. Industries with guaranteed power supply protected by provincial/regional policies  ALSO included is the priority list for industries TARGETED for power curbs.  If you're in one of these industries, you're gonna feel the pain:

It communicates information, but does it without any "wow".  Feels like one of those growth over time animations would show this more clearly.
1445301929198833665 2021-10-05 08:16:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattysino There's a tendency among anons to claim ridiculous shit with a stone cold poker face, and it's totally reasonable to demand reciepts.  Consider the lunatics your community is saturated with (and the particular low-IQ commentary that precipitated the conversation).

Against surging prices in late August, Zheneng looked around for where it could secure coal supplies and must have calculated that transporting by sea 30 days from Kazkakstan was still good value vs. other options.
1445046863049072644 2021-10-04 15:23:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra Should be directly related to the very low power prices for power consumers. Industrial power tariffs in Indonesia are almost the lowest in East Asia (lowest is China).

1445043099655303174 2021-10-04 15:08:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra When something is significant to the public good, its production can be regulated at an artificially low rate.  For example, in Indonesia, power prices are very low and PLN needs huge gov't subsidies. If ID had a free power market, prices would rise, or PLN would go bankrupt.

1445041165921710082 2021-10-04 15:00:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra I saw Daya Bay and Ling'Ao NPPs from wayyy across the bay when I climbed Qiniangshan on the Dapeng Peninsula back in the spring.  But you basically can't tell what they are in this picture unless you already know.   So I'd like to go do a tour for everyone (and me).  https://t.co/6uRWNmF0DJ
1445040620347662339 2021-10-04 14:58:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanAsra Depends on the plant. Daya Bay in Shenzhen is very accessible...they have tours around the outer areas and a hill with a viewing platform overlooking the reactor buildings.  Would like to go there when I'm back. 70% of its power goes to Hong Kong

1444993010924544003 2021-10-04 11:49:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 I found this for you:    https://t.co/1CgXltiDVk
1444991693829271557 2021-10-04 11:44:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, that's 3 power generation facilities in Hong Kong down, as I continue on my quest to hike to and photograph all 5 while I'm here.  Next time will be a 2 for 1, Castle Peak Power Station and Black Point Power Stations in Tuen Mun.  Last time:   https://t.co/xCSI5sXApZ
1444989877120999427 2021-10-04 11:36:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A perfect trail for combined hiking/power station enthusiasts! Obviously there are many of those out there, right?  The path continued down to the coast and around back north to the bridge. ~3-hour hike total. Saw just two other people on the mountain all day. Super recommended!  https://t.co/bOSDlaJhXG
1444989192933498882 2021-10-04 11:34:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And at the top...I was rewarded with my objective: an unmarked side trail leading me right above Penny's Bay.  By standing in the right spot and turning my head, I could see Lamma Station to the south, Penny's Bay below me, and even Castle Peak Station far to the NW.  3 for 1!  https://t.co/B7cuhTVFTz
1444989184104488974 2021-10-04 11:34:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After seein the plant at ground level, I decided to head up an unnamed hiking trail on the mountain behind the power plant, hoping for more interesting aerial views.  I got some great panoramas on the way up, of the East Bay, Tsing Ma Bridge, Ma Wan, Ma Wan Channel, and Tsing Yi.  https://t.co/YbAMeCnVze
1444989176676380676 2021-10-04 11:34:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And here's a sad, seatless Ofo bike I found under a bridge, which I guess has been bankrupt and defunct in Hong Kong for about two years now?  Ofo was supposed to collect all their bikes, but they missed this one for some reason...  https://t.co/vSqZ1cTmRS
1444989164856832002 2021-10-04 11:33:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As you can see from the picture above, I found it. Actually it wasn't hard. I just walked in as far as I could before the signs warned me to no go further.  There was no one around. This plant is on standby for peak load/emergency power supply only. It's usually turned off.  https://t.co/XMZ62G6lMW
1444989158783545349 2021-10-04 11:33:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Storytime!  Yesterday I went for a bit of light urban exploration/hiking in HK.  The destination was Penny's Bay Gas Turbine Power Station, a 330 MW gas-fired peaker station right next to HK Disneyland. It's owned by China Light and Power (70%) and China Southern Grid (30%).  https://t.co/StnA4O1r0m

1444912151169171456 2021-10-04 06:27:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tanfongkee I feel like half of twitter shitposting is just people letting out all their negative energy via their anon alts, saying all the stuff it's inconvenient to say on their main.

1444547187665342468 2021-10-03 06:17:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Tellythecairn Very American to call it an "independence day" but remarkable that the effort was even made.
1444545935636193283 2021-10-03 06:12:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Marklovesstocks @przidnt1 Xi got more than a bit of girth to him, no doubt. The giant insulated military parkas they use for the winter in northern China aren't gonna do anyone any favors either.
1444536477765963776 2021-10-03 05:35:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @copium_r_us @protocol @dwertime Relatively low yes. Although Oz coal is slightly higher kcal density coal, so it wasn't super straightforward to replace it. But 1) the imports have been replaced for months and months now. And 2) they offered no price advantage.
1444533177683382272 2021-10-03 05:22:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Should probably be "square centimeter" eh?
1444525177455333378 2021-10-03 04:50:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @protocol @dwertime Which means the premise of this lede is fundamentally incorrect. Importing Australian coal would have done nothing to alter willingness (or lack thereof) of coal-fired generators to generate power. It's not a geopolitics story.
1444524610075037698 2021-10-03 04:47:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @protocol Hey @dwertime , if you want to get the story about China coal correct, please ask a China power sector or commodities analyst.  What you have published here is incorrect. It's easy to check the price of Newcastle coal and confirm it's not cheaper than Chinese domestic coal.
1444361687147024385 2021-10-02 18:00:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @east_winds Oh gee, yeah I said that. How corny am I? üò≥  (If there are any big power consumers reading this, it's nothing personal. I mean this in a macro sense, for the long-term sustainability of the sector.)
1444335605853261826 2021-10-02 16:16:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 @moghilemear13 Everywhere. It's outta control right now because it's so hard to get new teachers in. Teaching jobs in SZ right now are posting at 25-30k...And rent may be included too. 2nd and even 3rd tier I bet 20k is common.
1444162791187750918 2021-10-02 04:50:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KennedyCSIS Not to mention, major decisions like moving a supply chain definitely don't happen after a few days or a week anyway.
1444151049648947209 2021-10-02 04:03:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let's just say coal stays 10% more expensive a while. Now PV/wind + storage will be competitive against coal. Of course nuclear too.  Power consumers, by virtue of demanding inexpensive, reliable power, will stimulate those sectors.  Market-led growth of clean power. The dream.
1444151047845339136 2021-10-02 04:03:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the past, that meant coal or hydro. The only reason to not choose the cheapest &amp; most reliable power source was to satisfy ESG goals.  But the very definition of what's desirable as cheap and reliable is now changing in China...
1444151046012506112 2021-10-02 04:03:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you're gonna stick around, you'll need to spend effort and resources future-proofing for wholesale markets with fluctuating prices.  Power consumers can increasingly choose their generation source. As usual, they'll create demand for the cheapest, most reliable source.
1444151044179521543 2021-10-02 04:03:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So...multinationals with China factories, are you ready to pay 10% more for coal power?  Yes, it takes time and money to move a supply chain, sure, but power is a HUGE cost driver. Especially for more high-consumption, energy-intensive manufacturers.
1444151042132746244 2021-10-02 04:03:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Could these 10% price hikes stick around for longer than a month or two?  Is this a one-off moment, never to be repeated, or should we see this as a signal that power prices could start to fluctuate more freely in the future?  I think the latter...
1444151040287277056 2021-10-02 04:03:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For generators, it seeems to be just enough to return them to profitability, or at least break-even/acceptable losses. Or else they'd likely still sit on their hands.  For power consumers...well in the short run of course you pay it. But over the long run...? BIG question.
1444151037938388994 2021-10-02 04:03:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now we're seeing many provinces choose to take the emergency approach of raising power prices for  consumers (10%), while we wait for the measures to increase coal supply to take effect.  What does this mean for generators and consumers?   https://t.co/UiCYYb0OGZ
1444151035837091846 2021-10-02 04:03:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Free markets for power in China means more expensive power for power consumers going forward.  For decades, manufacturers of all kind have been shielded from fluctuations in power cost. Someone else always ate it. Usually the power generators....never the factories.
1444151033937031172 2021-10-02 04:03:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now neep in mind that China is on a deregulation path for its power sector. It has been on this path for 20+ years...  The progress was pretty slow...until the last 2-3 years.  The eventual goal is a "fairly liberalized" power sector. Free-ish markets, but with guardrails.
1444151031571496964 2021-10-02 04:03:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For anyone interested if Chinese power shortages are an issue of a centrally planned power sector versus a free market power sector, please consider my theory I floated a few days ago.  Thread about power reform, supply chains, and their role in growing clean power.

1443207354191777796 2021-09-29 13:33:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @armyofall @GeeLedger While China's approach is not the only way, I have more faith in it than the approach taken by others.   ...Which is pretty much just let big companies do whatever they want and hope decarbonizing doesn't hurt their bottom line too much. Because if it does, they won't do it.
1443206427586154496 2021-09-29 13:30:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @armyofall @GeeLedger We're going from a heavily regulated power sector, on a path to an eventual liberalized power sector with strong state supervision. From 70% coal to carbon neutrality. Growing pains along the way are inevitable. This is an in-betweener moment for the sector, making it vulnerable.
1443205635776995333 2021-09-29 13:26:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay @armyofall @GeeLedger Chinese coal generators are struggling to even make a few bucks because they barely get crumbs to operate their plants. Meanwhile renewables have free dispatch.  China is using state mandate to create economic forces that nudge generators and users toward decarbonization.
1443163450067144705 2021-09-29 10:39:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @darkblackcoffee Yeah this is to be expected üôÉ Salty Australians aren't going to listen to me or anyone else though, no point in trying.
1443153423440875522 2021-09-29 09:59:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But also in a general logical sense, if it was still VERY unprofitable to run the plant at this offtake price, you probably wouldn't get 53 generators willing to bid in at 0.4983.  So if they're losing money still, it's at least tolerable for a bit longer at this new rate.  https://t.co/P4Ys5lbJ2i
1443153015670673415 2021-09-29 09:57:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The coal base price in Guangdong is 0.453. After 10% upward adjustment, we're at 0.4983.  According to @LantauGroup's cost model this *just barely* covers short run marginal cost in a modern plant burning 5500kcal fuel at 1400 RMB/tonne spot.  (heavily simplified for Twitter)
1443153013309202433 2021-09-29 09:57:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As expected, no problem whatsoever finding buyers for power in Guangdong at the new settlement price, 10% higher than the coal benchmark price. For most power users, it's better than no power at all.  Is it enough to return Guangdong generators to profitability? Hmm. Maybe?
1443133930710835208 2021-09-29 08:41:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq I could go check this in our power price model, but I'm feeling lazy. But it feels like at least for Guangdong, a 10% rise will be enough to get generators out negative territory....barely breaking even.  Definitely won't be enough for Dongbei and maybe other areas too, though.
1443133481635090432 2021-09-29 08:40:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq i.e. total clearing price of 0.453 + 0.0453 = 0.4983.   According to this Caixin article,  https://t.co/nCZ35O4Jyi  Coal prices at 1400 RMB/tonne = power production cost of 0.448, plus financial costs and other costs.  So maybe this is just enough for Guandong?
1443125729466540033 2021-09-29 08:09:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 @Obukowsky1 @US_China_Menu @allenjs @EricTopol Yes that's similar the numbers I had seen recently, except it was 55% fully vaxxed and 63% with at least one shot. Single shot spiking to 80% surprises me. How many people got their first shot in the last month??
1443124851011514373 2021-09-29 08:05:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @darkblackcoffee Yes, imports would provide no relief. The coal supply shock is felt internationally right now (and slightly more severely within China). People following the energy markets wouldn't bother to ask about imports, because they know coal is expensive everywhere right now.
1443123376059338753 2021-09-29 07:59:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @astraleureka @RealSexyCyborg @casastorta Yes the btc miners were tolerated &amp; even welcomed a few years ago when oversupply was high and there was widespread curtailment of hydro and coal resrouces in the West and SW. By this year, the oversupply had disappeared and mining's impact on energy intensity is intense.
1443122660716601346 2021-09-29 07:57:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg And for manufacturers that DO get their power restored, they're likely going to be paying more for it, with likelihood to pass those costs onto buyers.
1443122339521073152 2021-09-29 07:55:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Hard to imagine supply disruptions won't exist and persist into the winter. Hardest-hit will be the energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, chemicals etc.) Consumer goods, electronics, light manufacturing probably less exposed over long run, but definitely rough right now.

But even without the consuption/intensity goals, the coal would be scarce and expensive...

1442920241458147331 2021-09-28 18:32:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @elijpatton Do you have any evidence to support the assertion that the clean plate campaign was not about waste?
1442920105176752132 2021-09-28 18:32:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @elijpatton How is policy "moving in the other direction" ? I'm afraid I don't understand the specific point you're critiquing.  Coal production was short, leading to scarce, expensive coal and generators unwilling to operate their plants. This is a liberalizing system having growing pains.
1442883977371521024 2021-09-28 16:08:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @KaiserKuo Thanks Kaiser!
1442880899113123847 2021-09-28 15:56:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @elijpatton How are the power shortages not shortages, and how is that like the clean plate campaign?  (which I've personally heard nothing about since last year, what about you?)
1442868625916903433 2021-09-28 15:07:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay actually maybe this whole premise is flawed...because it turns out the Chinese Big 5 coal generators are also doing well over the last month. Seemingly no negative impact from the energy crisis. Huaneng, Datang, etc...all up.  And this is why I don't talk about investing.
1442867742848155652 2021-09-28 15:04:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Wwildsheepchase Hah good point...it could be. Actually I'm realizing the stocks of most Big 5 power generators have done quite well during the power crisis. This is mysterious to me.
1442866958035152903 2021-09-28 15:01:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @adam_tooze This story misses the coal pricing aspect, which is kind of the vital point. Energy controls on consumption much less pivotal.  Not much BJ can do get the lights back on for manufacturers now except focus on digging more coal and raising power prices...
1442863105927647244 2021-09-28 14:45:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @appledealy You're right, I didn't get a notification.   But congratulations! Cookies for you!
1442862644516380673 2021-09-28 14:43:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh come on, it's not that hard...is it?   Hint: Who benefits when coal is too expensive to dispatch?
1442849395540701191 2021-09-28 13:51:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @saurabhtodi To my knowledge, the nuclear fleet is operating normally and at full load except for Taishan Unit 1 in Guangdong, which should still be in outage for inspection of cracked fuel rods.  Hongyanhe NPP in Liaoning is probably operating at full capacity for the first time ever...hah.
1442844971795628036 2021-09-28 13:33:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> More provinces joining the party: Hunan raises its trading price cap as well.   https://t.co/lRx13y8O0A
1442824509556342793 2021-09-28 12:12:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There it is. Found the typo. There's always one.
1442823993182986240 2021-09-28 12:10:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mayer_iras Thanks for RT!  But please note that coal is expensive all over Asia now, so not sure that will be the answer either. Spot prices in the ports are nearly as high as domestic supply and more expensive after transport...no relief there.
1442820099971321862 2021-09-28 11:54:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also: If you are my follower and keen to track this story/China energy in general, make sure you are at least following @YanQinyq , @LHongqiao, @LiShuo_GP and @laurimyllyvirta.   Broader perspectives will make your understanding much more robust! I learn a lot from them all.
1442818483973083141 2021-09-28 11:48:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Anyway, that's the brief summarized for everyone, with some of my more philosophical musings tacked on the end for fun. Go read the thing if you're interested in the finer details. It's only 5 pages.  Obviously things still changing, so I'll stay on this topic if more happens. ü§ì
1442818481699713024 2021-09-28 11:48:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So my theory is: China's power sector was especially vulnerable to a fuel price shock at this moment in time, precisely because it's ony half-opened up, with coal miners and generators and gridcos separated, but lacking robust market mechanisms to guide them to economic outcomes.
1442818479451623425 2021-09-28 11:48:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. But the thing is, I think a more regulated and centralized power sector probably ALSO could have handled this better. The measures would be totally different, of course, but I think relief actions would have been swifter and more assertive.
1442818477153132546 2021-09-28 11:48:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. Could a more liberalized market have handled this better? Probably. If wholesale rates spiked like what we've seen in EUR, users would certainly curb consumption themselves anyway, but the silver lining is very strong signals for end-users to change their consumption behavior.
1442818475039154185 2021-09-28 11:48:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. In terms of the coal on-grid tariff structure, I don't think it's fair to blame policymakers/the gridco (like some coal generators have been doing). This is a very extreme case and China's market reforms are still young. The pricing mechanism was not designed for this.
1442818472807858177 2021-09-28 11:48:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. It's clear to me that there was/is systemic mismanagement of coal supply. For that much production to be taken offline, for a variety of reasons, but no mechanism in place to trigger a warning AND adjust course accordingly, is surely someone's failure.
1442818470651981826 2021-09-28 11:48:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the finally a question that isn't addressed in the piece, but is begging to be asked anyway: is this someone's fault?  Is this the symptom of a broken system, a symbol of failed reforms, or just "aw shucks, bad luck"?  I have 4 comments:
1442818468445708296 2021-09-28 11:48:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We point out that this is the first time coal costs have been passed onto the end-user directly. I believe this bodes very well over the long term for the attitude of major industrials and industry stakeholders toward coal power. If this happened once, could it happen again?
1442818465786519554 2021-09-28 11:48:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally, a discussion of the relief measures. In the immediate short term, there's really only two options: increase coal supply to lower cost, or pass costs of more expensive coal to end-users (or both). Guangdong is already trying the latter:   https://t.co/FisZrbHQK7
1442818463496433670 2021-09-28 11:48:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A very experienced Chinese colleague with 25+ years in the industry summed it up for me this morning: "In the other parts of the country, we can talk about bad luck, expensive coal, dual-control, whatever. But in Dongbei, someone will go to prison for this‚Äù.
1442818461177040898 2021-09-28 11:48:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course we have to talk a bit about the NE, which is out of control. No "ordered power consumption" here. There's been emergency load shedding a.k.a. sudden power cuts resulting in industrial accidents that sent ppl to hospital. Traffic lights died. Homes had no power.
1442818458702389252 2021-09-28 11:48:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This includes anti-corruption campaigns in Inner Mongolia that target coal bosses, takedowns of shadow-financed mines in Shaanxi, blue sky campaign in Shaanxi for the Chinese National Games, mine accidents in Shanxi, financial speculators, and also good old-fashioned hot weather!
1442818454843629568 2021-09-28 11:48:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> While we don't go into too much depth in the piece about the reasons for the coal shortage, the short answer is: a LOT of things have gone wrong at once with domestic supply to create a perfect storm. Some of these wounds were self-inflicted, others were just bad luck.
1442818452465467398 2021-09-28 11:48:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> #3 Finally, there are some actual available capacity shortages. mostly owing to very poor hydro performance this year in SW China. We note that Yunnan aluminum and steel companies have been curbing power since all the way back in May.  See:   https://t.co/X4WiJ3cBXW
1442818449646907401 2021-09-28 11:48:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We point out, however, that TRUE dual-use energy control measures are *also* in action right now. What do those look like? Well it's more like what @LHongqiao has documented in this thread: ground-level targeting of severe offenders:   https://t.co/l7fjUzA05b
1442818447470055428 2021-09-28 11:48:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> #2. Dual-control energy use policies, while important, in their own right, are likely only playing a small role here. Broad power cuts now wouldn't logically help provinces reduce consumption OR intensity over the long run anyway. So this must be mentioned secondarily to #1.
1442818444966068233 2021-09-28 11:48:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1. High fuel coal prices mean Chinese generators take losses on their generation. The regulated offtake mechanism does not have enough flexibility to rise to a level where generators can recoup costs. I wrote about this several days ago:   https://t.co/JO44IocsSj
1442818442529107973 2021-09-28 11:48:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, we chacterize power shortages across China as being caused by three key driversÔºö  1. Expensive coal leading to generator unwilling to operate 2. Power curbing due to provincial "dual-control" energy use policies 3. Available capacity shortage  #1 is the primary one.
1442818439576371207 2021-09-28 11:48:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LantauGroup has just published our watching brief on the Chinese power shortages. It is current to this morning.

1442516218615791616 2021-09-27 15:47:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq I guess it's some PR attempt to respond to angry industry.   Like "nooo we would never curb your power intentionally because of ÂèåÊéß, it's definitely because we were forced to by the hot weather and expensive coal".  A convenient excuse, considering their ÂèåÊéß is double red.
1442507284559458314 2021-09-27 15:11:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qian_junhui What should the local government do instead? State Grid doesn't have any power to dispatch.
1442491322082816001 2021-09-27 14:08:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LiShuo_GP Perhaps there's a few provinces that could realistically claim they are curbing consumption ONLY because of ÂèåÊéß...  ...but I think most in the industry will tell you the ridiculously high coal price causing generators refusing to run their plants at a loss is the primary reason.

1442315117010374657 2021-09-27 02:28:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qian_junhui Hi Professor, please note that the power rationing is due to the extremely high price of coal, so generators can't afford to run their plants without huge losses. It's kind of an extreme pricing event.  The markets are being adjusted to try to fix it:    https://t.co/FisZrbHQK7

Means the power shortage is now *very* severe in Liaoning.  Policy relief for Liaoning generators re: expensive coal such as what we've seen in Guangdong today urgently needed:   https://t.co/FisZrbHQK7
1442177348988637190 2021-09-26 17:20:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhongguoxin88 Nope, unless you have a direct UHV line from Northeast China to Southern China (there' isn't).  (And which probaby wouldn't happen anyway, because that would be going from State Grid's territory to China Southern Grid territory).
1442176722984525824 2021-09-26 17:18:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 (and Texas has its own grid that's connected to nobody else's because Texas).
1442176571947642889 2021-09-26 17:17:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 For anyone who is curious about the screenshotted image:   1. Northeast grid is very far from the Southern grid. They're not even connected. 2. Huawei's office building is a commercial power user. Usually industrial users are asked to ration first.

1442145511771820034 2021-09-26 15:14:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Guangdong is just one province, ofc, but it's a national leader so it makes sense we'd see action here first.  Other provinces need to see similar policy ASAP to incentivize generators. Situation is already more severe elsewhere e.g. Liaoning:   https://t.co/Lwh3Qz2Esx
1442145509255172102 2021-09-26 15:14:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Making users pay more for their coal power helps China chase so many energy related goals.  It motivates energy efficiency, reduces consumption and intensity, incentivizes rooftop PV and storage, makes utility solar/wind more competitive...it's almost a power sector panacea.
1442145507254562843 2021-09-26 15:14:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> To sum: this is a watershed moment for the CHN power sector.  Coal's role as a cheap, reliable baseload source is under challenge. The belief that power prices can never rise, only fall, is also being challenged.  And the markets are being used as the path to relief.
1442145504771510273 2021-09-26 15:14:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The end of the notification even warns end-users: if you're going to participate in the market, you aren't allowed to withdraw from it later without a good reason, or else be forced to suffer a 3-year ban from the market, during which time your retail tariffs will be 20% higher.  https://t.co/ShupoMSa30
1442145498844917761 2021-09-26 15:14:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's also very important that we're seeing an attempt to provide relief to generators via regulation of a market mechanism, not via direct regulation like a subsidy.  So much effort has been put into building these markets...regulators really want consumers to use them.
1442145496810733578 2021-09-26 15:14:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the past, we have seen generators forced to absorb higher fuel costs, and we have see the grid forced to absorb higher fuel costs, but I can't recall that I've ever seen higher fuel costs passed directly on to *end users*  It's a system-shocking moment.
1442145494789091330 2021-09-26 15:14:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I am a bit skeptical whether a 10% rise for monthly wholesale contracts can get most generators back into profitability, considering how expensive coal is now. But the policy does leave room for further adjustment.  Even this small step is a first for the industry.
1442145492880691200 2021-09-26 15:14:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With these higher settlement prices possible, some generators should be able to afford to buy coal and keep producing power.  I have no doubt they'll find wholesale customers at this new, higher price (remember, the alternative right now is no power at all).
1442145490833870849 2021-09-26 15:14:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So! As a short-term measure, new limits have been established for bidding in the mid-term wholesale markets.  Monthly transactions are now allowed to close at a rate up to 10% higher than the benchmark coal price.  In Guangdong, that means 0.453 + 0.0453, or 0.4983 RMB/kWh.
1442145488707276803 2021-09-26 15:14:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The article points out that on September 24, the price of coal in GZ Port reached 1550 yuan/tonne, (holy crap) an increase of 310% YoY. Natural gas prices soaring even higher, up 610% YoY.   So the generation cost of power is higher than the benchmark price (uh yeah, obviously).

After pro-rating Sichuan hydro capacity for poor rainfall, I suspect Central Grid is in far more dire straits than installed capacity on paper would indicate...
1441753584224256004 2021-09-25 13:16:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 @AngelicaOung @china_cent @YanQinyq It was a few places, including Hubei I believe. But at peak summer demand,  I assume those were capacity shortages, not related to coal pricing at that time.   Hubei same grid as Hunan, which had shortages last winter. Central Grid reliant on Sichuan hydro which has been poor..
1441751529753497605 2021-09-25 13:08:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq Technically "shortage of peak load" could also mean "coal generators are refusing to operate because coal is too expensive", right?   Or is there some language used to clarify that these are two separate problems?

1441747526776807428 2021-09-25 12:52:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung You can look at  https://t.co/1ungKW3qt0 for the quick comparisons on Chinese coal prices btw.
1441746326866202643 2021-09-25 12:48:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Chinese domestic coal prices are even higher than the stuff coming in through the ports though. The supply crunch is sector-wide and rergion-wide.
1441744669243678729 2021-09-25 12:41:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @donaldcclarke @ZhangTaisu Have a nice day Donald
1441743048698851332 2021-09-25 12:35:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @donaldcclarke @ZhangTaisu So you're going with the "China is extremely incompetent" defense then?  If they were just some regular innocent guys, I wonder why the Chinese authorities would even think they were good counter-leverage, with Meng on the other side of the scale.
1441739499747233806 2021-09-25 12:20:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @donaldcclarke @ZhangTaisu It seems you're going with the "If they were arrested in China, then they couldn't possibly have been guilty" defense.
1441700997563248640 2021-09-25 09:47:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChongXuCheng Well it's required to get a work visa in, e.g., China (if you aren't Chinese). Obviously doesn't affect locals but is relevant for those looking to expatriate.
1441692290351722497 2021-09-25 09:13:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhangTaisu @donaldcclarke And that applies to more than this case...  Starting with the premise that the Chinese authorities are ignorant, stupid, incompetent, or evil and trying to understand all PRC actions within that framework leads to very poor analysis.
1441691753040384006 2021-09-25 09:11:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhangTaisu @donaldcclarke Do people really think they were selected by throwing darts at a wall full of Canadian passports?  I mean I guess you can, if you assume the Chinese side is extremely incompetent or just stupid. Which, come to think of it, is exactly what your garden variety China Watcher thinks.
1441608553794465795 2021-09-25 03:40:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @LobitasRunning Guangdong recently approved new power tariffs that make it very expensive to use power during peak hours. But they don't take effect til October 1. If there's a plan to get that money back to the generators, then maybe they can afford to run the plants.   https://t.co/vP3pMByKTy
1441607055400312836 2021-09-25 03:34:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @LobitasRunning In this case I'm not sure it would help much, because generators get paid the same for their power regardless of what time of day it is. If grid companies were actually paying more for power and passing those costs to the customers during peak hours, then yes.   Also labor laws?
1441605525838336000 2021-09-25 03:28:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @LobitasRunning Yeah we're only in September now, but seeing coal prices as if we're facing a cold front in midwinter.  So when we actually get to winter and heating demand picks up, it's going to get worse unless we dig more coal outta the ground or adopt emergency power pricing measures.
1441603319902846979 2021-09-25 03:19:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Hey, thanks for the tag. I wrote about it just last night:     https://t.co/JO44IocsSj
1441457410451722246 2021-09-24 17:40:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Chrispy416 They'll only need to figure out a solution for the area around the sports venues in Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou cities. I suppose as much gas or maybe wind that can be brought in via UHV lines from NE China that can be used, will be. Anything to keep local coal plants off.
1441454397486092288 2021-09-24 17:28:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Chrispy416 Production being cut led to high coal prices, which led to generators unwilling to use coal.  In the months leading up to the winter olympics, heating demand will rise actually.  I have no idea how they're going to balance Jan/Feb heating needs vs. blue skies.

1441442289960640512 2021-09-24 16:39:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 @LantauGroup We're pretty much always recruiting for experienced talent on a rolling basis btw. It's just we're especially dying for analysts right now.
1441441715055824897 2021-09-24 16:37:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> P.S. Of course some provinces are cutting power for a different reason right now; they are trying to get back on track for their dual-controls for power intensity and consumption.  That's a separate situation entirely, not related to capacity or coal:   https://t.co/5mdfJ0gf5u
1441441712853839882 2021-09-24 16:37:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Aside from increasing coal production, putting some emergency price measures into place for the on-grid coal tariff could grant some relief, such as raising the base price, or increasing the float range, so generators aren't losing too much money.  State Grid can afford it... üòà
1441441710903422985 2021-09-24 16:37:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some issues will resolve themselves too.  There was a mine accident in Shaanxi that required temporary production cuts for safety inspections.  Also some production had been cut in Shaanxi to ensure good weather for the China National Games which will end on Monday. üôÉ
1441441708797935617 2021-09-24 16:37:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So instead of operating and losing mountains of money, they're just not running, reducing supply and forcing industries in various provinces to ration power.  What to do?  Well China obviously could add more domestic production of coal, which is what is being "supervised" now. üßê
1441441706910502921 2021-09-24 16:37:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So yes, that's a heck of a lot more of a rise than what the on-grid pricing mechanism can handle. It was designed for gradual changes throughout the year, not sharp increases of 20 or 40 or 60%.  Generators can't operate their plants profitably. üò≥They'll lose money on every MWh.
1441441704930734087 2021-09-24 16:37:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Meanwhile the domestic supply situation is just as bad.  For instance, Shanxi premium 5500 kcal mixed coal hit 1116 RMB/tonne last week, up 18% *over the last 10 days*. Ordos 5500 and Datong 5500 are a similar story.  Power industry, steel industry, everyone's in pain.
1441441703039176722 2021-09-24 16:37:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So what have coal prices been doing? You've heard they're high, but how high?  Qinhuangdao Port 5500kcal FOB this week: 942 RMB/tonne, up 60% vs. this week last year. üò≤  Coal prices right now are close to what we saw in Jan during the coldsnap (when they reached 1110 RMB/tonne).
1441441701017522176 2021-09-24 16:37:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2020 was the first year of this "base + float" mechanism. But there are rules: The float component can only add up to 10% onto the base price.  After that, the base price would have to be adjusted, which requires NDRC review (also the price couldn't go up in the first year).
1441441699142664194 2021-09-24 16:37:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In 2019, China changed from this benchmark tariff to a ‚Äúbase + float‚Äù tariff. Âü∫ÂáÜ‰ª∑ + ÊµÆÂä®‰ª∑  With this, the base rate is still fixed, but there's a floating price component that can be adjusted on a more immediate basis and incorporate short-term volatility in fuel prices.
1441441697242632193 2021-09-24 16:37:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the past, China's on-grid tariff was fixed at a single level called the coal benchmark.  The coal benchmark was rarely adjusted and often lagged market changes that affected generators' costs like fuel prices. It was an imperfect mechanism and needed to be updated.
1441441695313235980 2021-09-24 16:37:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What does that mean?   The "coal on-grid tariff" is the rate that the grid company pays a generator for power. The gridco then sells that power to end-users.  The on-grid tariff rate is supposed to be high enough to cover costs and ensure profitable operations for the generator.
1441441693291536390 2021-09-24 16:37:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, let's look at this small but important news that caught my eye today:  The NDRC + NEA have now dispatched teams at provincial level to supervise the increase of coal production and review implementation of the "base + float" on-grid coal tariff.   https://t.co/gAXTspg8xn
1441441691341242370 2021-09-24 16:37:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China Coal Power Tariffs for Dummies:  This will be a thread to explain one extremely key concept: how coal-fired power is priced in China, and how it reacts to the price of fuel.  Understanding this is key to understanding why many provinces are Rationing Power now.

1441323040374071301 2021-09-24 08:46:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ulywang Removing access to the cheap coal projects from China very well may provide the impetus to improve the unattractive policy environments that currently hold back these countries' solar or wind sectors from being more competitive and affordable.
1441322445651152913 2021-09-24 08:43:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ulywang So for Indonesia, making solar power attractive and affordable is a matter of changing policy and improving project bankability for international developers.   But Indonesia's problem is not the same as Vietnam, or Pakistan, or Bangladesh. They have unique and distinct issues.
1441321931198713857 2021-09-24 08:41:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ulywang Every single situation in every single country is different, and it's pointless to talk about them broadly.   Example: Indonesia is drenched in sun. It could have VERY low LCOE for solar projects. But it doesn't, cause it also has a local component requirement for solar projects.

Since it exists online it surely will be cited by some foreign media as proof that "Chinese netizens expressed skepticism that the move was truly motivated by climate goals".

Dongbei food started getting really popular in Shanghai in like 2015. When I moved to SZ, there were already dozens of places too. It's like it never happened here.
1439639269228773379 2021-09-19 17:15:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @chinahelpdesk There's only 3 dongbei restaurants in the whole city according to dazhong dianping ü•≤   like how?

1439539940648312841 2021-09-19 10:40:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @20ping3 It was tolerated a few years back in provinces that had major surpluses of hydro, wind, coal, etc. But by 2021, with power shortages, decarbonization goals, etc, they had overstayed their welcome. Nic Carter wrote about it here: (I helped a little)   https://t.co/BTBzWLUfU3
1439453783197585409 2021-09-19 04:58:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you're a major industrial getting your power throttled because the province isn't on track to meet its consumption goals, not sure there's much you can do other than build rooftop PV.  And if it's a power intensity issue, then demand shifting is advised. Storage would help.
1439453780764807172 2021-09-19 04:58:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This doesn't help with the other indicator though: energy intensity.  Provinces struggling with their energy intensity goals would be more interested in spreading loads throughout the day. The new Time of Use tariff schemes speak directly to that:   https://t.co/cSTyWH4mrQ
1439453778575433728 2021-09-19 04:58:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Operationally, I think how this would work is the provincial gridco must procure more RE for the provincial power pool, since this is being evaluated and controlled on a provincial level.  Then they can happily dispatch to industry without it counting against consumption limits.
1439453775723331588 2021-09-19 04:58:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Important to note a province's renewable energy consumed above quota levels (RPS) does *not* count against the energy consumption limit.  So if provincial govts are getting a lot of flak from their industries about having their power throttled, one solution is to procure more RE.  https://t.co/jLcqgkpc74
1439077200112730112 2021-09-18 04:01:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @luandong Although to be fair, it's hard to say how much it's been dampened. After all, 2020 was a crazy year for installs with the expiry of FiT looming, so what's the actual 'benchmark' to say whether 2021 installs are high or low or average, you know what I mean?
1439076018409537543 2021-09-18 03:57:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @luandong This was all most relevant for the period of time about 2014-2018, when curtailment levels were high but developers kept building like crazy because the attractive 20-year FiTs were the more important factor.  FiT going away since the start of 2021 has had a damper.

1439059772871905282 2021-09-18 02:52:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung @StephenPaduano I know Goldwind has been very active in greenfield builds around the world, using its own turbines. But I don't know much about SOEs' overseas strategies on the whole. Have they been targeting greenfield too? With Chinese turbines?
1439059277780447235 2021-09-18 02:50:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung @StephenPaduano Oh yeah several of the big Chinese developers have big wind portfolios in Eur already (via acquisition I believe?). Not my area, just I know they're active.  My comment was describing SOE behavior domestically tho, where the curtailment and FiT policy were very specific to China.
1439036740077973507 2021-09-18 01:21:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @StephenPaduano *This was about Chinese SOE *domestic* wind investment üòÑ
1438858352600121348 2021-09-17 13:32:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @AngelicaOung @YanQinyq The subsidy rates in 2019 and 2020 were already super low because of the FiT auction mechanism, so those would be the first projects to abandon their subsidies in favor of selling in the markets.   Circa 2014/2015 projects on the other hand..haaaaa. That will take a while.
1438857706543087619 2021-09-17 13:29:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @AngelicaOung @YanQinyq Wholesale RE premiums aren't close to matching the subsidized offtake rate generators enjoy now. But in a few years...With RPS requirements getting stricter, corporate renewables procurement ramping up, general supply tightening, coal capacity peaking...Who knows?
1438856949383065603 2021-09-17 13:26:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @AngelicaOung @YanQinyq Well, if wholesale prices are strong enough, the premium for power comes from the same place and goes to the same place. Either power users pay a premium via wholesale market or a surcharge on their regulated tariff (that funds the subsidy). The generator gets paid either way.
1438852596689633286 2021-09-17 13:09:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung @gonglei89 @YanQinyq Issa rumor!

They've been unloading assets left and right...  Like paper hands in the wind..

1438842870425743373 2021-09-17 12:30:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The researchers conclude that mainstream research of Chinese SOEs generally understates their economic rationality and the degree to which market logic plays a role in their business operations and decision-making.  And point out that this is indeed by design:  https://t.co/avmjPv4kuw
1438842860053303296 2021-09-17 12:30:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sure, the subsidy fund payouts were delayed, but they were guaranteed to get paid...eventually.  If they waited a few years for the curtailment to drop, maybe the subsidy rate would decline, or other companies would snap up the prime real estate. So they had to keep building.  https://t.co/dTgorT6BVO
1438842852507734017 2021-09-17 12:30:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Finding 5:   SOEs were hustled by local gov'ts to build wind projects even amidst severe curtailment and a loss-making environment because subsidy rates were declining each year.  If they failed to act on their land usage rights, they'd lose their preferential offtake prices.
1438842848275693575 2021-09-17 12:30:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Finding 4:   SOEs even manipulated their financial models and intentionally underestimated curtailment rates to inflate IRR and get their projects approved and built.  Knowing full well they'd lose money for the next few years. Because it was so key to get in early. Wow!  https://t.co/yzDczcKqjS
1438842842760167425 2021-09-17 12:30:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This partially explains why the Chinese wind sector is dominated by SOEs while the Chinese solar sector has far more private players.  SOEs can afford to keep high-CAPEX, unprofitable assets on their sheet for a long time, waiting for relief they trust will come.  https://t.co/7keIuFB3rA
1438842837496328193 2021-09-17 12:30:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Finding 3:  The SOEs accepted that projects might be non-economic in the short-run, trusting that policy would be adopted to reduce curtailment and bolster renewable consumption over time.  Winning market share and access to prime wind resources first was more important.
1438842834954588163 2021-09-17 12:30:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key Finding 2:  SOE decision-making for wind power projects is not arbitrary.  Projects had to pass several rounds of evaluation and review internally, and economic performance was benchmarked against other projects in the same region.  https://t.co/RCxHvvHdoH
1438842818760302596 2021-09-17 12:30:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW the information I'm sharing here comes via a 2019 paper from researchers at Tsinghua and the University of Leuven (Belgium) titled:  "The China wind paradox: The role of state-owned enterprises in wind power investment versus wind curtailment"  link:  https://t.co/IyUxKLZBrp

1437628278622199808 2021-09-14 04:04:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @honglilai Well it's not like G2 reactors have had a poor safety record overall, just that G3 are designed to be even better.  The Chashma reactors were built in Pakistan in the early-mid 2000s. So there was no G3 tech available to build at the time. Their most recent exports are G3.
1437588885601615873 2021-09-14 01:27:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mightylzrdking Not sure I understand the question. I don't believe there's any inherent danger to either of those things the way you've described them.
1437460806292045829 2021-09-13 16:58:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not sure how reliable the story is - surely there are other factors too. But spending all those resources to extend the license of a small, old, relatively dirty reactor makes more sense in that context.  Anyway, congratulations to Qinshan 1 for its newly extended lease on life.
1437460803532177408 2021-09-13 16:58:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So they decided there was strategic and commercial value to apply for license extension of Qinshan 1.  This would pave the path for later, hypothesized work to extend the operating licenses of the similiar reactors in Chashma, should Pakistan choose to go that route...
1437460800348717056 2021-09-13 16:58:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The way it was (ancedotally) explained to me a few years ago by guys at the engineering and design company owned by Qinshan's parent company, it was mostly because the CNP-300 unit at Qinshan I is the reference unit for China's 4 exported reactors to Pakistan at Chashma.
1437460797534314496 2021-09-13 16:58:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Qinshan was grid-connected in 1991 and had an initial license period of just 30 years, which originally would have ended in December of this year.  At first CNNC planned to let this reactor shut down. This was the story back around 2013-2014. But things changed. Why?
1437460794669551618 2021-09-13 16:58:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the United States, most operating reactors have already reached the end of their initial 40-year licensing period and have secured a 20-year license renewal.  Some have already secured a second license renewal (i.e. another 20 years, extending to 80).   https://t.co/IRXRC7WVfL
1437460790886293505 2021-09-13 16:58:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The technology is generally fine to keep going, so this is more of an economic decision.  It's the cost of peforming all the inspections, equipment upgrades/replacements, verifications, etc. to meet license extension demands vs. the value of 20 more years of power generation.
1437460787258265601 2021-09-13 16:58:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A reactor's lifespan is determined by its operating license from the regulator, usually 40 years for 2G reactors.  After 40 years, the reactor operator may choose to apply for license extension to keep operating the plant (usually another 20 years).   https://t.co/KzOc3ZD7Rs
1437460784364199942 2021-09-13 16:58:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China's oldest nuclear reactor, the 300MWe unit at Qinshan 1, got an extension on its lifespan today - all the way out to 2041.  It's the Chinese industry's very first license renewal and a nice acheivement.  So what is license renewal?    https://t.co/1WNIOSfkyi

1435447068156313602 2021-09-08 03:37:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mfceli @RnaudBertrand A great observation and another missed opportunity/poorly executed strategy.
1435445262726549507 2021-09-08 03:29:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChongXuCheng I think that's a good point. It is absolutely related to the age and life experiences and backgrounds of the people in the decision-making positions in these departments right now.
1435444873272840193 2021-09-08 03:28:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Joshua_Fern I always thought a travel media person who masterfully merged politics into their thematic topic (in this case food) was Anthony Bourdain. He never made a secret of his politics, but also never let it take over the show. Maybe others would disagree but I really enjoyed it.
1435443891302383621 2021-09-08 03:24:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wukailong Yep. An entirely publicity strategy based on vibes. And poor information.

1435441490088456195 2021-09-08 03:14:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielOlimac And yes, some China Youtubers are very good (I'm not gonna share names here).  I actually suspect the ones that I think are really good wouldn't even disagree, because the same thing that makes then good in my eyes would also make them appreciate the logic here (I think/hope).
1435439625808400386 2021-09-08 03:07:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielOlimac Yeah that's a fair point. No need to reallocate when you have enough money to just spend more.  Although in some cases I actually think they do more harm than good.
1435438019285172229 2021-09-08 03:01:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not to say that I think we deserve special treatment, just that China clearly has an incentive and an objective to improve its perception in the eyes of non-Chinese, is already allocating resources to that end, and appears to getting *very little* in return right now.
1435437415108276227 2021-09-08 02:58:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And before the wounded comments roll in like: "they should be learning it anyway, why should we incentivize these fragile Anglos?"  The money is already being spent. Ineffectively, in my view. If you're gonna give laowai special treatment, at least do it with competence.
1435436412082417670 2021-09-08 02:54:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What if China took its budget for sending youtubers on travel junkets and reallocated into an incentive system for Z visa holders to learn Chinese?  In terms of getting non-Chinese to actually understand/connect with China &amp; Chinese people, I think ROI would be higher.

Unfortunately small anon accounts saying random racist shit on Twitter aren't ever about to have an epiphany and do a 180 on being an waste of biological tissue just because you took the effort to explain what's wrong with them. :/

1435183565063344129 2021-09-07 10:10:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Really feels like the maturity and penetration of the power trading markets went from 0 kmph to only 30 kmph over a period of 3-4 years, and then went from 30 kmph to 100 kmph in the last 9 months.
1435183562286776327 2021-09-07 10:10:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This comes on top of the news from a few months ago about in-province renewable power trading in Guangdong.  This time we're talking about trading power from thousands of km away.    https://t.co/jvi4YNWHRK
1435183559426252803 2021-09-07 10:09:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is very exciting news for the C&amp;I ESG green procurement sector (basically the RE100, Science Based Targets crowd).  For several years, cross-province corporate PPA for green power has been an "hmmm someday, surely, but not really clear when" item in China.

And perhaps that's on the agenda, now that the first step of establishing basic economic activity and infrastructure to service it has been ticked off.

Sometimes it takes, sometimes it doesn't.

It was management-consulted. They said "ok the plan is to have a tourism industry. Let's build the infrastructure to make that happen. Here's the SOE that will spend the funds."

1434045369692819460 2021-09-04 06:47:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Obviously I don't speak Zhuang and can't tell you how good this attempt at romanizing its pronunciation is(or isn't (.   How do you think a "z" at the end of a word sounds in Zhuang??
1434044572468842496 2021-09-04 06:44:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Common to see this on signs in Guangxi, but uncommon in other places (like SZ).  The text under the characters is not pinyin, but rather an attempt at transliteration of these characters' pronunciation in the Zhuang langauge, which is where the restaurant is from.  https://t.co/mJsMCAgdf2

High likelihood to see HPR1000s in several African nations by 2035.
1433697663992545281 2021-09-03 07:45:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The next African nation to build commercial nuclear will be Egypt, which has already signed an agreement with Rosatom.

The cheaper they get, the more functions they can serve, displacing more expensive alternatives.
1433274906460839943 2021-09-02 03:45:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Currently batteries are too expensive to be profitable for their owner in many cases. The best economic cases are end-users ducking high tariffs and grid storage batteries selling frequency regulation.  But the 15% capacity mandate on generation end will drive mfg. costs lower.
1433274902572720130 2021-09-02 03:45:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So that's another way the RE generators *could* make money from their batteries...if they were allowed to sell their storage in the spot market. They aren't yet. But it's planned for the future, definitely. Spot markets are just now allowing renewables, with storage to come.
1433274898848227333 2021-09-02 03:45:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The first column deals with time shifting. Basically storing the power when purchase prices are low and selling it when prices are higher (i.e. arbitrage of power).   For this to work, batteries have to be allowed to sell in spot markets. China doesn't have this yet.
1433274895165624329 2021-09-02 03:45:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But at some point in the future, the massive amounts of renewables coming online will exhaust all available flexible resources in the system. And then the 15% storage will make sense and the generators will find good revenue for their batteries.  For now they're sad.
1433274891331989513 2021-09-02 03:45:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is actually somewhat controversial. Industry experience worldwide indicates renewables don't need attached storage until their penetration is quite high in the system, over 30%. China is nowhere near this.  So for now, the storage is just extra CAPEX for developers...
1433274887443914754 2021-09-02 03:45:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With a lot of intermittent renewables coming onto the grid, there's more demand for AS to make up for the variability.  China mandates new renewable projects to be built with 15% of their capacity covered by stoage. So a 50MW solar plant would need to prepare 7.5MW of storage.
1433274883769716744 2021-09-02 03:45:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ancillary services are needed for some duration that lasts anywhere from fractions of a second to several hours. Anyone authorized to participate in the market could meet that need and earn the bounty for providing on-the-spot service...batteries, pumped storage, even gas plants.
1433274879902502915 2021-09-02 03:45:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now onto the second column. Ancillary services (AS) are when the grid needs some small amount of power to fulfill a certain purpose, like smoothing out power frequency. This power is traded in a market exchange like a commodity. Storage is a good fit for meeting these needs.
1433274876190605315 2021-09-02 03:45:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As long as the cost of building the battery facility and cycling through charge/discharge is cheaper than the cost of building a new distribution line, then it's a smart investment.  This is called "grid investment deferral".
1433274872457695232 2021-09-02 03:45:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It'll be so expensive to build a new, larger line.  Fortunately, I realized that I really only have a supply problem for around 2 peak demand hours per day.  So I a build a battery that I charge up at night and make available during the peak hours, temporarily boosting supply.
1433274868598861824 2021-09-02 03:45:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But now in the last few years, the area has become popular with tourists. Some new guesthouses and restaurants have been built, and power demand during peak hours is getting close to the maximum that the skinny little distribution line can handle. What should I do?
1433274864916307971 2021-09-02 03:45:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pretend I'm State Grid. A few years ago I built a distribution line to a rural mountainous area in Sichuan, bringing them power for the first time.  Their power demand wasn't high and the terrain was really difficult to build in, so I only built a skinny little distribution line.
1433274861216944128 2021-09-02 03:45:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Okay that's easy to understand. What about the rest of the bubbles in my infographic?  Well it turns out the third column is also pretty staightforward. Sometimes building a battery is cheaper than building new grid infrastructure.
1433274856670257156 2021-09-02 03:45:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Just this week Guangdong revised its tariff structure in accordance with new regulations.  It raised peak rates, lowered off-peak rates, and made  end-user battery storage MUCH more attractive for large power users in Guangdong.  Peak rate is now 5x more expensive than off-peak.  https://t.co/RXpkpDIoBo
1433274847921016833 2021-09-02 03:45:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The difference between peak and off-peak tariffs will determine how economically feasible my battery is.  If the gap isn't wide enough, then it's not worth the cost to install the storage. Increasing that ratio makes my battery storage economic.   https://t.co/cSTyWH4mrQ
1433274836705439754 2021-09-02 03:45:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The fourth column is the easiest to understand. I'm an end-user. Maybe I'm a hospital or data center. I need *reliable* power. I buy a battery.  OR...my utility charges more for power at certain times, so I charge my battery during low price hours and discharge during peak hours.
1433274832792141826 2021-09-02 03:45:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I prefer dividing the market this way because batteries installed by almost anyone in the system could be used for these applications, as long as they have a market to sell their power.  China's wholesale power markets are slowly developing now, with future outlook for batteries.
1433274828073553931 2021-09-02 03:45:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This infographic lists out the most common storage applications.  Every bubble is an area where someone in the power system has a problem that can be solved by discharging a battery, and would be willing to pay the battery owner to discharge the battery at the right moment.  https://t.co/PbxYloZzt6
1433274812604960772 2021-09-02 03:45:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So who uses batteries? One easy way to define the market segments is by their role in the power value chain: generator-end, grid-end, and user-end.  But to be honest, this way of defining segments isn't too isn't helpful. A better way IMO is to define by application case.
1433274808624578560 2021-09-02 03:45:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Electricity is an instantaneous, real-time commodity. If it's not consumed in the moment, then it's gone. Energy storage like batteries changes this.  The fundamental philosophy of strage is: is allows electrical potential to be stored and dispatched *whenever it is needed*.
1433274804623196162 2021-09-02 03:45:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Power Sector for Dummies: Battery Storage and China  What's the deal with batteries? What are their role in the power system?

1430920803000881161 2021-08-26 15:51:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pzhang100 I would assume power intensity of the major industry in Shandong is higher than Guangdong.  Steel, concrete, chemicals, aluminum, etc. are your big power users. Of course Guangdong has those too, but I would think a big piece of Guangdong's industrial GDP is electronics.
1430742205950435328 2021-08-26 04:01:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Reminder to follow @LantauGroup for more general updates on the APAC energy sector.  And if it's a tweet about China, enjoy watching me QRT myself...
1430742203505152009 2021-08-26 04:01:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nukes!  There aren't enough plants in the Shandong nuclear pipeline to hit this goal.  Current operational + under construction = 5.7 GW. The sum of pipelined plants that could realistically start construction by 2025 adds only another 4-5ish GW.  Hmmm...   https://t.co/PWjjNt33Wg
1430742201328226312 2021-08-26 04:01:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Wind!  Shandong already has 18-19 GW of wind, so trying to hit 25 GW by 2025 isn't super ambitious.   Offshore wind is still too expensive I guess. Most of Shandong's RE additions will be coming from solar.
1430742198945865738 2021-08-26 04:01:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Solar!  Trying to get to 57 GW vs ~25 GW currently, in just 4 years, is YUGE.   This version even added 5GW versus the draft version from May, highlighting opportunities in what they call ‚ÄúPV plus‚Äù (e.g. a fish farm with floating solar mounted on top).   https://t.co/52MkRPIZoE
1430742196727152652 2021-08-26 04:01:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These captive power plants have been a headache for the sector. They're usually old, dirty, inefficienct plants. They aren't grid-connected, so many have succeeded in dodging surchages that were supposed to go to e.g. financing renewable subsidies.  Happy to see them targeted.
1430742193782673408 2021-08-26 04:01:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Coal!  Closing small coal is interesting for Shandong especially. Shandong is famous for having a TON of captive coal plants. That means plants built for the self-use of large industrial facilities, not grid-connected.  Many of them will be under 300 MW.   https://t.co/4519oHK8Hd
1430742191392002052 2021-08-26 04:01:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to this article, the capacity at the Longdong site is 80% renewable energy (so about 8 GW).  Renewables will account for about 64% of the power output after adjusting for capacity factor.  So the Longdong UHV imports will be...eh...kinda clean.   https://t.co/PWPE25i0AD
1430742188892200962 2021-08-26 04:01:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Imports!  Increasing imports is pretty much a given, as Shandong local capacity can't keep up. The Longdong-Shandong UHV 800 kV UHV line that is supposed start construction this year should help.  The massive 10 GW Longdong project is in Gansu.   https://t.co/m2Mp6dBv0c
1430742186388189185 2021-08-26 04:01:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shandong Five year Plan on Energy just dropped.  Although the national FYP determines the Big Picture direction of the sector, the FYPs for the individual provinces show us how it's actually going to get done.  I picked out some of the good stuff for you:
1430731200713224192 2021-08-26 03:17:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @William60378254 Wow this Axios article actually said that exactly. Nice one Axios.   https://t.co/4MSLbJU46o  https://t.co/ihs6mq63MQ
1430705987275530240 2021-08-26 01:37:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Okumura_Jun @ianbremmer If it was commissioned in 2020, then it started construction in 2016 (at a time when generation cost of wind and solar was still *much* higher than coal).  I admit "mothballed" was imprecise. Coal plants aren't shuttered; they just are forced to run at low load factors.
1430609079534194689 2021-08-25 19:12:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @William60378254 Beyond that actually. When China committed to carbon neutrality 2060, it also set its carbon peak at 2030.   Now with *coal* peak at 2025 but *carbon* peak not until 2030, carbon emissions may still rise other sources between 2025-2030. Lots of tension still to come.
1430608231546580993 2021-08-25 19:09:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @William60378254 Keep in mind with coal prices the way they are right now, it's not even cheaper. The generators aren't allowed to pass the higher fuel costs onto the buyer. Many of them are taking losses.  It is understood as a necessary evil by everyone except pretty much coal miners. üò≥
1430607480560574464 2021-08-25 19:06:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @William60378254 Yes, they're building *everything*. The Five Year Plan called for coal peak in 2025, which I think will be very hard, with demand the way it is right now.  We're rationing power right now in several provinces. There's excess power in the system, but it's in the wrong places.
1430605107058548740 2021-08-25 18:56:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @William60378254 There's a way to word it without it being a dog whistle, e.g.:  "China's electricity demand has spiked 14% YoY. With renewables already fully dispatched, this has left nothing to meet that demand but coal, leading to an unwelcome surge in carbon emissions."
1430604126128246791 2021-08-25 18:52:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Being forced to turn to previously-mothballed coal capacity because of a demand spike is a PItA for any entities that have taken on RE consumption quotas. How do you meet your quota when demand is soaring and there's no RE to consume?  You consume coal or you curb production.
1430602758361518080 2021-08-25 18:47:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The fact that higher than expected demand was mostly met by coal meant that the resource that had previously had excess capacity to soak up extra demand was...COAL. Because it was being curtailed and kept to low load factors, IN FAVOR OF RENEWABLES.
1430602391510863873 2021-08-25 18:46:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In fact, if demand was much higher than expected over a short period and it was all met by more renewables, that would be a problem.  That would mean there was previously a ton of renewables on the system, not getting dispatched, being wasted.
1430601724335583232 2021-08-25 18:43:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is a very disingenous way of summarizing the situation.   Power assets aren't built overnight. If demand rises in a short period, you meet that demand with the existing generation assets you have. It's not like a choice was made to *not* dispatch renewables.
1430598849068879878 2021-08-25 18:31:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RnaudBertrand It varied greatly by city. Shenzhen was fully shut down for several weeks, including restaurants.

1430448240466350080 2021-08-25 08:33:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I mean, this article is from 2018, but imagine reading the title, skimming key points, and coming away with the conclusion:   "Beacuse LCOE of solar is still too expensive and the subsidies are getting yanked, it's maybe time to dump Chinese solar".   https://t.co/UBgPVGBApY
1430446535943200768 2021-08-25 08:26:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I refer specifically to renewables by the way - Solar, wind, batteries - whose fortunes are all heavily reliant on policy and which therefore require actually being able to read Chinese energy policy documents and understand what you're looking at.

1430337381870096385 2021-08-25 01:13:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealNatashaChe @opensea Interesting experiment, and a vivid one for those who may be struggling to understand the underlying principles.   With this tweet, you appear to have developed the most powerful Reply Guy bait known to humankind, so that's also pretty special.
1430335175754276866 2021-08-25 01:04:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Obukowsky1 @stillreezy Most colleges don't accept the extra points and subtract them. I learned this last week in the countryside, from some of the Yao locals. The only ones that take the "ethnic minority bonus" on the gaokao are the minzu universities, which have a quota for ethnic minorities.
1430226597919870976 2021-08-24 17:52:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Looks like they are hiding their selfishness and/or irrational choices behind a wounded presentation and emotionally manipulative gaslighting language. I'd be really uncomfortable if someone I counted as a friend started talking like this. Must be hard for you.
1430137880475697155 2021-08-24 12:00:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @erikengheim @dandamdar @HanAsra Exports and eventual coal plant retrofits, yes to both. Also strategic diversification of options for next gen technologies. Cost per MW is quite hight right now but should come down with subsequent builds.
1430118639013797896 2021-08-24 10:43:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @erikengheim @dandamdar @HanAsra Yes, the HTGR just completed fuel loading, and no, it's not on schedule. I think the original target completion date was 2017 or something like that. But as a FOAK prototype reactor, it doesn't have as much of that kind of pressure.
1430100502327357446 2021-08-24 09:31:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung @CynthiaGarbutt @QContrarian @austbondlover It also has the added benefit of being a real thing, so there's that. üòÇ
1429956924095688740 2021-08-24 00:01:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @miller_wf Yeah that's a good one. Âõß was a really popular internet word when I was learning, so I did encounter it early, but otherwise you'd have no reason to. There's also Ëø•ÁÑ∂‰∏çÂêå and a few more other uncommon ones.
1429875897297817600 2021-08-23 18:39:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Atomicrod Could be a neat swap out operation in the future decarbonisation efforts. Although I imagine that China's supercritical coal plants, as their newest and most efficient/modern plants in the fleet, would be the last ones to exit the market over the coming decades.
1429875283071422479 2021-08-23 18:36:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq @Jyves1994 We had a professor in grad school who tried to make us handwrite our final exam, but the class protested so much, he allowed us to bring a dictionary to class...but only a paper dictionary, no phones allowed. Painful memories...

1429870178792218628 2021-08-23 18:16:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango The last one from those examples I learned was definitely chuai, that's why i put year 5, although it might even have been later. I remember I was being mock threatened like ÊàëË∏πÊ≠ª‰∫Ü! and i was like whoa waaittt what word was that?
1429868525217206290 2021-08-23 18:09:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 Fiao is basically a meme anyway IMO lol  Cen is a fairly uncommon but not absurdly rare surnameÂ≤ë . And I've seen it in place names. But never seen it in a word.
1429866635276406790 2021-08-23 18:02:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @labaccount_app Oh yeah, of course, but it only has one common character, Â´©, that's the point. And I don't think I would have learned it in my first year of Chinese...maybe my memory is off.
1429864902039007232 2021-08-23 17:55:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And a phoneme you learned in your first semester of Chinese because you Googled "what's the hardest Chinese character"? ü§°  https://t.co/oXA8Wb5EPW
1429864888717889539 2021-08-23 17:55:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Phonemes you learned in your first year of Chinese without realizing that they're actually extremely rare phonemes, used only in 1-2 characters:   shei, gei, dei, zen, lia, ri, re  Phonemes that only exist for memes:   duang
1429864885400178688 2021-08-23 17:55:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Examples of phonemes you don't encounter until you learn Chinese for 2 years:  l√ºe, nen, shai, fo  Or 3 years:  zei, shuan, seng, miu, n√ºe  Or 5 years:  cen, chuai, weng, cuan, lo  Or never: üôÉ  Èû• (eng)Ôºå Ë¶Ö (fiao)  (which ones have I missed?)
1429864882090905601 2021-08-23 17:55:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nerdy late night musings for Mandarin language learners:  One of my small delights in learning Chinese is my "collection" of rarely-used phonemes.  Imagine learning a foreign language for years and discovering there's a sound in that language that you've never uttered before.
1429859285748490288 2021-08-23 17:33:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Elvibarri9 @ZichenWanghere Just now I was trying to describe how Beijingers pronounce Ë°å. it's like xi-yung or xi-eng, very nasally.  And I accidentally discovered the archaic character Èû• which is pronounced "eng" and that has made my evening, because I didn't even know that was a possible phoneme in CHN.

To avoid such situations, I talked a lot.  Result: for years my oral Chinese was my best of the 4 and my listening remained shite
1429815830200537088 2021-08-23 14:40:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blob_watcher Like noahpinion. People keep saying he's very smart and has good takes about a lot of things. But as far as I've seen, his commentary on China is just a parade of breathtaking stupidity. So like, what gives?

1429683432569769987 2021-08-23 05:54:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *Italicized reactors were concepts that were never completed and instead merged into the HPR1000/Hualong One.   *Technically there's an intermediary step between M310 and CPR1000, where they were kind of "Chinese M310s" (Ling'ao Phase 1).  *CAP1400 is sometimes called Guohe One.
1429682482262155265 2021-08-23 05:50:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Made this a while back, but since it seems I have a lot more nuclear followers today than I did back in April, so here's an infographic laying out the three major Chinese nuclear tech trees for fission power.

1429479938193645571 2021-08-22 16:25:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zebraimage @SeanUM_China If you asked an intelligent person:  "What if you had near-unlimited resources and a population that will do whatever you you tell them.

1429122391146328065 2021-08-21 16:45:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Everyone in the village has been super friendly and happy to talk. Mrs. Zhao said they're all so bored recently (lol). It would be a great time to film a documentary!  This has been an amazing trip, and I've really enjoyed learning and sharing with Twitter. Thanks for following!
1429122388222902272 2021-08-21 16:45:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Another interesting point of Yao culture according to Mrs. Zhao - there's no preference for sons vs daughters (even predating the modern era, when the area was agricultural &amp; non-mechanized).  Other sources online state that Yao culture was historically matrilineal.
1429122385362386945 2021-08-21 16:45:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not only that, but husbands may move in with their wife's family after marriage (this is quite unusual).  Mrs. Zhao told us you may even see banners that say "ÂñúËøéÊñ∞Â©ø" over the door at the home of the bride's family at the wedding party (i.e. "welcome to our new son-in-law").
1429122382229250048 2021-08-21 16:45:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With these kinds of stories, it's not hard to imagine how Mr. Yu has been able to organize the villagers to stay unified, and how they've been able to get their way against the development company/county gov't (and why Ping'an has been unable to ).    https://t.co/ARH76S2Jet
1429122379343491076 2021-08-21 16:45:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This appears to be a super pristine and authentic version of the family (ÂÆ∂Êóè) culture that used to be the norm, but has slowly receded recently, especially with migration and urbanization. Nowadays you'd probably only see it in TV and movies unless you've got rural family.
1429122376474656768 2021-08-21 16:45:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Or: (per Mrs. Zhao) Recently some young guys from the village had a disagreement with the development company over a road being built that passes the village. There was a fistfight and 6 were arrested.   The whole village pooled funds to bail them out the very next day.
1429122372322295811 2021-08-21 16:45:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> e.g. Yesterday when hiking, we found a rest pavilion built on the trail, in the middle of fields. A stone plaque commerorated the 17 people (16 Pans, 1 Yu) who had pooled money, labor, and materials to the project.  25 CNY and 2 days of labor. 20 CNY and 3 days of labor.  etc...  https://t.co/PzgW4K9ILl

You don't even have to wait for the news because you'll see the fireworks (or see someone preparing for a feast).  When someone builds a new house, everyone chips in to help with construction.
1429122352168660992 2021-08-21 16:44:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> That's because nearly everyone in the village is related.  About 90% of the population is surnamed Pan ÊΩò. The last 10% are Yu ‰Ωô. That's it.  If you don't know someone's name, you can greet them as ÊΩòÂì• or ÊΩòÂßê (Brother Pan, Sister Pan).  At the post office, every parcel is Pan.
1429122349257740288 2021-08-21 16:44:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I also asked how she's been able to adjust to life in the village, as an outsider. She said the villagers have generally been welcoming, and they've been invited to parties for weddings, new year's celebrations, etc.  But she's definitely not "part of the family".
1429122345315143682 2021-08-21 16:44:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She told us that the soil in Dazhai is actually really bad for growing anything besides rice, peppers, and bamboo. Vegetables from outside the region grow poorly and she prefers to buy most of her vegetables from Guilin.  We've seen ample evidence of the thriving pepper crops:  https://t.co/9LI18NDPV1
1429122326814068738 2021-08-21 16:44:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She's also bringing in flavors from the rest of the province into her restaurant, like cold fermented tofu Ë±ÜËÖê‰π≥ which is one of the "three treasures of Guilin" (Ê°ÇÊûó‰∏âÂÆù).   Holy shit this stuff goes hard. Funky, spicy, salty, umami, it's delicious but like getting punched.  https://t.co/f5ppj9S7Rf
1429122314168266756 2021-08-21 16:44:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And her ËÖäËÇâÁÇíÈ•≠ (fried rice with chunks of local cured pork) is some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  https://t.co/LX5gh0c6e3
1429122306916327431 2021-08-21 16:44:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> She told us the villagers traditionally ate very light with almost no spices and they had to adjust for tourists' heavier tastes, so she's had an advantage.  Her bamboo roasted smoked chicken is perfection, with a creamy broth full of wild mushrooms and TCM spices.  https://t.co/z9X2G85GFB
1429122292542435331 2021-08-21 16:44:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mrs. Zhao is an outsider in the village, originally from Shandong, here for 2 years now. Her restaurant ÈáéÊúõ is (in our humble opinion) the best in the village, and the high rating on Dazhong Dianping agrees.  We've eaten here 4 times in the last week.  https://t.co/aVntDnd8GK

1428917270697320448 2021-08-21 03:09:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chinahelpdesk @jodyavirgan @mranti There are a few. Suzhou shares an airport with Wuxi, or else you can go to SHA, but it's not connected to either of them via metro.  Dunno if Guilin is considerd a major city, but it doesn't even have a metro yet (the first line of the planned metro will connect to the airport).
1428912070020325382 2021-08-21 02:49:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jodyavirgan @mranti If you're leaving town, you should be able to get to get to the airport easily via public transit. Being forced to drive any number of minutes and paying to ditch your car in long term parking is not convenient.  Which disqualifies most US cities from contention.

1428736414447931392 2021-08-20 15:11:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt I think the next village over (Xiaozhai) is currently the new Dazhai. It's just barely under development now and no one goes there, but in a few years, who knows?  Dazhai is really stunning now - I would definitely recommend it over Ping'an for anyone thinking of coming.
1428735806840074251 2021-08-20 15:08:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @zhang_schmidt Makes sense they'd have a company making chili sauce. Some of the fields I saw today had replaced the rice entirely with chilis! I'll ask tomorrow...
1428732935130140678 2021-08-20 14:57:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> btw @zhang_schmidt  I was inspired to take this hike after checking the link to your website!  The Tianzhouzhai -&gt; Zhongliu -&gt; Ping'an path is in bad shape right now. No one is maintaining large parts of of because of reduced tourism from covid. Wearing shorts is awful.
1428731077057679361 2021-08-20 14:50:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Pictures from the hike, if you read all the way to the end.  https://t.co/2enbEyBWZl

The issue is their branch secretary. He's just not tough enough".  Ouch...
1428730794529353730 2021-08-20 14:49:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When I got back to the guesthouse, I told Mr. Yu that the villagers of Ping'an are unhappy. He immediately knew I was talking about the situation with the sightseeing car (kinda get the feeling he knows everything going on).  His response summarized my conclusion nicely:
1428730787436797956 2021-08-20 14:48:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> His story about his frustrations with the development of Ping'An really highlighted for me how crucial the personal character of the village leader is.  The villagers are of course quite weak individually without a leader to unify and speak for their rights vs. "the company.‚Äù
1428730784500699143 2021-08-20 14:48:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Or: It's really tough for the village children to go to school over 1 hour away in the county city. Mostly they live at school and the parents rent or buy a place nearby, to Èô™ËØª. It's expensive and tiring to get the kids an education.  But at least they *can* go to school now.
1428730781426323456 2021-08-20 14:48:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course things overall for him and his family are better than before the region opened up.  E.g. He mentioned that when he was 8, he ate nothing but braised bamboo shoots and rice for 3 months straight because there was no other food. Today, he still hates the taste of Á´πÁ¨ã.
1428730778473558019 2021-08-20 14:48:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He used to make good money leading hiking tours between Dazhai and Ping'an (the route we did) and running a coffee shop.  Now Covid has cratered his businesses, the company is making life harder for the village, and he wonders if he made the right choice to return to Longji.
1428730775650721799 2021-08-20 14:48:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Basically, their branch secretary had either caved to pressure or just minded his own profits, so the villagers of Ping'an now have to accept this touring car that bypasses the village.  Overall, he said he's quite disappointed with the development of Ping'an
1428730770059792390 2021-08-20 14:48:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The company just added this feature suddenly, without consulting the villagers. They get a cut of the proceeds, but it's less than what they could earn before, and they are unhappy no one asked them what they thought.  Their elected mayor/branch secretary didn't do anything.
1428730766909874177 2021-08-20 14:48:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He said the company had recently added a touring car to bring tourists from the parking lot directly to the mountaintop.  It bypasses the village and removes a bunch of opportunities for the villagers to make money selling goods, carrying bags, driving tourists themselves, etc.
1428730763017527296 2021-08-20 14:48:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He told us things are pretty bad at Ping'an. Not only is Covid hurting the business, but they know their scenery isn't quite as good as Dazhai's, therefore less tourists, and many villagers feel they're getting screwed by "the company" (the one that develops the scenic area).
1428730759813029892 2021-08-20 14:48:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The road back is a winding mountain road that takes 25km to return (the hike was only 10 km remember). So we had a lot of time to talk.  Our driver/ice cream vendor was a Ping'an local, young guy, college educated, back to the village for 6 years since graduation.
1428730755912396810 2021-08-20 14:48:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When we arrived after a tough hike (the path is overgrown &amp; washed out in some places), we had no energy.  So we snapped our pics and found a local guy closing his ice cream stand who was open-minded to make a buck to drive us back to Dazhai.  Blue= hiking path Red = road back  https://t.co/p2cLGRSuDc
1428730748723372033 2021-08-20 14:48:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> On the surface, Ping'an is quite similar to Dazhai, where I've been staying. The villagers are Zhuang, not Yao (ethnicity).  The mountains around there are way more steep and impressive. Its rice terraces are not as pretty, in my opinion. They ain't ugly either though.  https://t.co/66JYUR1fo7
1428730653873295362 2021-08-20 14:48:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So what happens if the local leader does a lousy job of protecting the villagers' interests? What's the flipside?  Today I found out.  I took a 10km hike over the back rice fields, bringing me to the next village over, which is called Ping'an.
1428704068101234693 2021-08-20 13:02:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @finalexodus1 @SecondRingSZN Don't snitch tag

1428397794306392065 2021-08-19 16:45:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's an article I found online about the dividend payments in the village last year where they also talk about his new guesthouse.  There are a few pics of Mr. Yu if you're curious what a dude taking massive W's looks like.  End.   https://t.co/LEy4Ctu4Pj
1428397791634628611 2021-08-19 16:45:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So it turns out I have Mr. Yu directly to thank for this being the place I love to come back to, year after year.  BTW it's the same Yu as the one in my Chn name (‰Ωô). He was quite amused by that when he was checking me in. About 10% of the village has this name. The rest are ÊΩò.
1428397789310976001 2021-08-19 16:45:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He thinks he's effective at the local level precisely because he doesn't want a career in government.  He just wants to have a successful guesthouse and see the village do well, while preserving their way of life and natural environment to the maximum extent possible.
1428397787004084227 2021-08-19 16:45:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is something the development company and county gov't are really pushing for, and he's fighting them on.  He knows the county gov't dislikes him, and he doesn't care, because the choices that make him unpopular at that level also let him win the village elections.
1428397784730800135 2021-08-19 16:45:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The massive influx of tourists that will come with the 5A rating, and that will be necessary to get ROI, will overwhelm the village.  He doesn't think their infrastructure or natural environment can handle it, and they don't have facilities befitting a 5A attraction anyway.
1428397782352613376 2021-08-19 16:45:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So anyway, back to the question about going for 5A.   He's VERY against the idea.  The 5A rating requires huge upfront investment to secure. He estimated ~150M USD. If the city or province spends that much money on upgrading Longji Rice Terraces, they will want a return.
1428397780049928193 2021-08-19 16:45:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I asked him "What if the county governor is a local? Wouldn't they take care of the locals too?"   He said "Actually we hope they are not a local. If they are a local, they have too many connections and friendships. They will build up too much power and paralyze development".
1428397777659125762 2021-08-19 16:45:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> While the county governor or party secretary will likely be careerists, only interested in seeing the county's GDP rise so they can tick boxes and move on to bigger and better posts, he has no such ambitions...he just wants to make sure his people are taken care of.
1428397775352262660 2021-08-19 16:45:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In this case, "the outsiders" include the county-level gov't and the development company from Guilin which operates the scenic area.   He's the highest level of defense the villagers have that they can vote for, to represent their interests against the outsiders.
1428397773011881991 2021-08-19 16:45:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> He's a local guy, went away to Nanning (Guangxi's capital) for college, and returned to the village, unlike many others of his generation. He said he's successful in the elections because he puts the needs of his villagers above everyone else, especially "the outsiders."
1428397770717614080 2021-08-19 16:45:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So Mr. Yu is basically the leader of the village, and a popular one. He won the last election with over 90% of the vote (population around 1000).   (At the village level in China, leaders are selected via popular vote, which may be surprising to some of my followers).
1428397768368791558 2021-08-19 16:45:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> After the delegation left, I cornered him for Q&amp;A and he luckily was chatty.  That's when I discovered he's a local Big Deal (he said he was both ÊùëÊîØ‰π¶ and Êùë‰∏ª‰ªª so I think he's both mayor and branch secretary, although idk if that's possible?). His name is Mr. Yu.
1428397766103818241 2021-08-19 16:45:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Turns out they're debating if they should try to get Longji Rice Terraces upgraded to a 5A tourist attraction (vs. 4A right now).  For those of you who don't know, 5A is the cr√®me de la cr√®me. There are ~300 of them in China, vs. ~1300 4A. So getting 5A is a big deal.
1428397763570528260 2021-08-19 16:45:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I had a suspicion he was some kind of local VIP when I saw him receiving a delegation from the Guilin company that developed the scenic area, along with a batch of college students. I thought they wanted his perspective about running the guesthouse.  So I eavesdropped...

1428387520178311168 2021-08-19 16:04:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 Yes absolutely. If you're really into enjoying the taste of coffee, grind it yourself from freshly roasted beans (which expire too btw).

The outcomes of both testing and modeling have been pretty effective in modeling the concrete's behavior under impact, and it performs well. It's not some kind of open question.
1428363921203687428 2021-08-19 14:31:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung Thought you'd never ask. :)    https://t.co/UDeo4cloq5
1428360622798819338 2021-08-19 14:18:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AngelicaOung I'm reminded of when I got extremely excited doing a thread about how nuclear power plants are protected from aircraft strikes, only to discover basically no one cares. And I got called a nerd.
1428359847771197440 2021-08-19 14:15:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew Our guesthouse boss lady said that now they have lots of oil, her mother likes to cook everything with TONS of oil. Kind of if you have it flaunt it. But they push her to tone it down because most of their guests are from Guangdong, and they don't like heavy oil dishes.
1428359147343417348 2021-08-19 14:12:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew So I asked and basically they said traditional food didn't have a lot of sauce because they didn't have a lot of oil, soy sauce, etc. Buying stuff in town was a full day hike. So most people just cooked everything with a bit of oil, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of MSG.

Even if you don't personally agree with those positions espoused therein, they ought to be respected as being within the "band of reasonable discourse", and not dismissed off the cuff on a moralistic basis as "regime propaganda."
1428329650321645571 2021-08-19 12:15:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @ruima Imagine the full spectrum of discourse that's metaphorically, say, 100km wide.  And then there's a band within that where the so-called "reasonable and appropriate discourse on China" lies that's only like 20km wide.  That "10 myths" thread is outside the 20km band.
1428255169322504193 2021-08-19 07:19:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Some of the 'myths' are a little strawman-y. Or at least I don't hear them that often to put in a top 10. But the points are well stated.
1428159785900208129 2021-08-19 01:00:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BobNeiwen @gonglei89 @hurt_chinese Oh I remember. Guess his feelings got hurt.

1428156312286744576 2021-08-19 00:46:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Breakfast at the guesthouse: rice noodles with an egg and mushrooms, congee with two types of cured veggies, sweet potato, mantou, red bean bun, soy milk.   All the carbs I'll need for working in the rice fields today ;)  https://t.co/3GQGOmPLun

1427992277956272134 2021-08-18 13:54:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And even with the struggles of running the hotel, paying the bank, annoying/rude tourists, etc. they still think the developments are a huge win.   After all, pre-2003, they had no paved road, no power, and had to hike 23 KILOMETERS to town to buy things like oil and salt.  End.
1427992272906317825 2021-08-18 13:54:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Which is why they've earned a 4.9/5 score on Ctrip, one of the village's highest. Also, they've managed to keep their guest counts pretty high even while other places have suffered.  Almost all the rooms were full last night, even as 75% of the places in town are closed.
1427992270377086976 2021-08-18 13:54:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Guests can be really difficult to please, especially when they come from the cities and are expecting to be waited on like royalty, with the limited resources available here.  But they have a beautifully designed space, with extremely attentive and thoughtful service.
1427992267432730631 2021-08-18 13:54:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Running a guesthouse in the rural mountains is expensive. The power goes out easily when trees brush against power lines, but they're aiming for perfect reviews, so they decided to invest in a 40k CNY backup diesel generator, that cost 3k CNY just to transport to their location..  https://t.co/9YkG6oe3C1
1427992261648781315 2021-08-18 13:54:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In the family, the husband and wife handle most of the day to day on the hotel operations (15 rooms) while her father still mostly tends the fields and her mother leads the kitchen.  Other family members are involved too, except her 4-year old son, who spends all day watching TV.
1427992256858836999 2021-08-18 13:54:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Low-interest loans were available from the rural credit collective, but they coudn't offer big loans larger than 50k, so not enough to build a guesthouse.  So they had borrow from a big bank in Guilin, which has not been sympathetic about their reduced guest flow during Covid...
1427992253679607815 2021-08-18 13:54:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> By 2019, they saved up enough for the down payment on the guesthouse they have now. It's 5 floors, one of the most luxurious (and expensive!) in town.  They have a bank loan for the unbelievable sum of 4M CNY! (about 600k USD). Their monthly payment is 20k.  https://t.co/j0N4qr22RD
1427992246536708097 2021-08-18 13:54:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At the start, everyone was taking guests in their old houses, but now the standard has risen drastically. They can charge 300-1000 per night with new facilities. Old houses maybe can get 50-150 per night.  This pic from another part of the village shows the contrast clearly...  https://t.co/DoAwwnQsfu
1427992145575645190 2021-08-18 13:53:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our hosts started taking guests in 2009. At the beginning, everyone opened guesthouses but money was scarce, so they bought the furniture ONE ITEM at a time to decorate the rooms - a TV here, a table there.  Then someone got AC and they ALL had to. Keeping up with the Zhous!
1427992142849273861 2021-08-18 13:53:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Like I did for my trip last year, (RT'ed below) I'd like to take a moment to share some more information about the people who own the guesthouse I'm staying in this year. My intention is to make them and their lives a bit less abstract.  Thread
1427851659619696640 2021-08-18 04:35:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BobNeiwen @passluo I was remembering reading this thread while I wrote my own today. Thanks for linking it.

1427841547115012100 2021-08-18 03:55:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Watch steam come out of my ears anytime I hear tourists in China complaining that they just wanted to find the "real China" but they don't see it in the cities.   Like sorry you weren't able to get your fill of poverty porn while traveling in China.
1427839025545498625 2021-08-18 03:45:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GregHerczeg Wow, you'd be shocked to see what this view looks like today - the number of guesthouses has probably doubled.   This looks like it was from Â§ßÊØõÁïå, halfway up the mountain? I can see the area where I'm staying now, although my hotel isn't visible because it was built in 2019.
1427836975768240128 2021-08-18 03:37:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So yeah, maybe it's not quite as romantic and idealized as a "real" mountain village that didn't have the benefit of some great natural resources to leverage into tourist attractions.  But honestly, there's nothing romantic about sustenance rice farming and poverty.
1427835773663932421 2021-08-18 03:32:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nowhere is ever going to 100% maintain its identity after opening up like this. I notice the younger generation doesn't wear the traditional clothing (the elders do) and many of them have gone to the city to work.  But the ones that stayed seem like they're doing well.
1427835770681757696 2021-08-18 03:32:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And although it's not obvious from the pictures, there are signs of modern comfort.  I wandered through the village and saw washing machines and kids with ipads. The farmers trim the terraces with weed-whackers.   I found a packet of sulfur tricyclazole, a modern fungicide.  https://t.co/9qnTTT1uaV
1427835764822274052 2021-08-18 03:32:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the county gov't appears to have invested a lot of money in making sure the infrastructure can keep up with the tourism.  I noticed new light poles and a sprawling 150M USD wastewater treatment system that connects all the villages on the mountain with 17 km of pipes.  https://t.co/BJRjz9kw72
1427835759134867466 2021-08-18 03:32:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What's remarkable, though, is how little the landscape has changed. The new guesthouses have to adhere to the same architectural style and visual elements of the older buildings.  Even this coffee shop in the parking lot for the caffeine-crazed city slickers like me.  https://t.co/D4jiTfmbhL
1427835753321570304 2021-08-18 03:32:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The cable car at Dazhai was only built in 2015 (barely visible over the mountain in this pic).   My hotel manager told me there are now ~600 hotels, guesthouses, and homestays throughout the scenic area, although the majority are closed right now because of the reduced tourism.  https://t.co/TWwdxMlZQL
1427835744207265804 2021-08-18 03:32:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In '05, the local gov't began promoting and supporting the development of tourist guesthouses, and the 4A tourist attraction designation came in '07.  I visited for the firs time in '11, and it was still VERY underdeveloped at that time. It's come quite a long way...
1427835741967503360 2021-08-18 03:32:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As far as I can see, this is the platonic ideal for a rural poverty alleviation program.  It leverages the stunning natural environment into big tourism Ôø•, while profit sharing with the locals who make it possible, and pouring profits back into [subtly] modernizing the village.
1427835739333554180 2021-08-18 03:32:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Following up on some observations from last year:  Had some interesting chats today with locals. This place was opened to tourism (poverty alleviation) WAY more recently than I would have guessed. The mountain road to connect the villages was only built in '03!  (short thread)

1427646988758274052 2021-08-17 15:02:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew I'll keep a specific eye out tomorrow and ask some more questions :)
1427645983953928193 2021-08-17 14:58:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew Hmm not that I've really noticed...everything is so light.
1427643726738903058 2021-08-17 14:49:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew I mean of course now they can go buy soy sauce in the little stores and they use it in cooking.  There's a lot of pickled and cured food used for seasoning, so sour and salty from that.  Otherwise flavors are very light, not much oil, not a lot of spicy peppers, etc.
1427640941368782869 2021-08-17 14:38:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChefMiew Traditionally I'd guess no, since soybeans aren't grown here
1427636528059232269 2021-08-17 14:20:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. They really don't import much food from the outside, even to this day. I imagine using vegetable oil for wok-frying is a relatively new development in the last few decades since it has to come in from outside. Probably used mostly animal fats before I'd guess.
1427635367994331138 2021-08-17 14:16:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. This year tourism has been bad, so many guesthouses are temporarily closed while the people have left the village to work outside, so they don't need their pigs. One restaurant told us they've been buying their pork from a family who have temporarily closed their guesthouse.
1427634782993854476 2021-08-17 14:13:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CarlZha @moghilemear13 Wow I've actually been there (many years ago). Leather city!
1427634594661244940 2021-08-17 14:13:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. We drink fermented rice wine at every meal, and it's usually added to the bill for free. It's very low alcohol content - about 3%. Always served very cold too, which is interesting compared to how China usually treats cold beverages. Every family brews their own.
1427634591028944908 2021-08-17 14:13:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. The speciality dishes of course are bamboo rice and bamboo chicken. They are is roasted inside the bamboo over charcoal. Chickens run freely everywhere in the villages, so it's the most ready source of fresh meat. Beef is quite expensive.
1427634587841277959 2021-08-17 14:13:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. Most things served in the small restaurants are local, so you don't have a huge variety of vegetables, pretty much just what the villagers grow themselves or forage for (like mushrooms). There's about 4-5 diffferent kinds of vegetables I've seen everywhere.
1427634584909459467 2021-08-17 14:13:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So cured sausages ËÖäËÇ† or ËÖäËÇâ are the most common way of eating pork throughout the year. You can see that in the 4th picture above - the cured pork with stir-fried bamboo shoots. Fresh pork is available but it's from outside.
1427634581872783376 2021-08-17 14:13:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few facts I've learned about the culinary culture here:   1. Fresh pork is not a normal part of the diet, since each family raises just 1-2 pigs per year and slaughters them before the New Year, having a big feast and curing the rest of the meat for use throughout the year.

1426514466997342211 2021-08-14 12:02:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @M_L_Bryan This is very fair and I need to reflect on it.  I've seen people with "EN/‰∏≠" in their bio and considered that approach myself. I used to show off all the time, and now I'm really sensitive about appearing performative. But I really am happy to receive outreach in Chinese.
1426505809999982592 2021-08-14 11:27:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SeanUM_China @M_L_Bryan By the way, I think a full time career, in China, working at a Chinese company, in PUBLIC RELATIONS, like Sean here, is a pretty solid rationale for having your Chinese name as part of your public profile...
1426504952914972673 2021-08-14 11:24:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 I wanted a ‚Äò‚Äôproper‚Äô name though, so it had to be ‰Ωô or ‰∫é. I really considered È±º, but it's too uncommon. I didn't want to go through my whole life of people telling me "well actually that's not a real surname" and me saying "no, it is, I promise!" üòÖ
1426501970378989571 2021-08-14 11:12:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZzGgWw5 I guess it really depends if you plan on participating mostly in English twitter or Chinese twitter, yeah?
1426499005953961987 2021-08-14 11:00:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wotyagerrin I should really change that...it's associated with some website project I was working on 10 years ago...üò≥  I was always Â∞è‰Ωô at work until I got a promotion and let the beard grow a few days, and then I magically became ËÄÅ‰Ωô...lol
1426496793563459588 2021-08-14 10:51:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> P.S.  To be clear, this does NOT mean every non-Chinese person with a Chinese name in their handle. But I think a fair number of prominent China-oriented journos, think tankers, media commentators, and academics could use some self-reflection on this subject.
1426483592113180673 2021-08-14 09:59:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW I have no tolerance for gaslighting or broken bottles scamming or whatever this is, so you're muted now.  Go back and read the whole thread and consider what you're really upset about and if you've really chosen the right target for all this angst.
1426477718489604096 2021-08-14 09:36:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW I'm talking about people using a foreign name as a false credential of expertise. If you aren't doing this, then there's nothing to get your feelings hurt over.
1426470231279476740 2021-08-14 09:06:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW I'm referring to a specific class of Chinese Name Haver here, that's not beginner Chinese students looking for friends...  If you feel specifically called out as the target of this last post, then I'm not sure what to say.
1426466200175841286 2021-08-14 08:50:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW  https://t.co/NhattJwCgl
1426458724156141572 2021-08-14 08:20:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And to end with a subtweet...for those of you using Chinese names on your socials as an attempt at lazy insta-credentials, asserting your supposed expertise to a world that doesn't know better with no other supporting substance..  ..yeah, we all see straight through you losers.
1426458721861869576 2021-08-14 08:20:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So anyway, that's my logic. That same structure could reasonably lead other people to decide the opposite.  I encourage those of you who *do* use your Chinese name on your socials to ask yourself these hypotheticals and make sure you are comfortable with the answers.
1426458719424946178 2021-08-14 08:20:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And as for qualifications in my career, I definitely don't think I need a Chinese name on my social media to demonstrate that.  Someone's credibility in their China-adjacent career should be readily observable via the the quality of the content or commentary they produce.
1426458717080330244 2021-08-14 08:20:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> These days, I know exactly where my own level is and I don't need to prove it to anyone, and certainly not via   a few characters in my username.  All I'll say is that it's not as good as @akaDashan, but more than good enough to be farming clicks on YouTube, if I wanted to.
1426458714781798401 2021-08-14 08:20:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I used to use my Chinese name on my Facebook, in parentheses next to my English name. It seemed a very normal thing to do for Chinese students.  But as the years went by, and my Chinese improved, I no longer felt the desire to make sure everyone knew, all the time.
1426458712424648712 2021-08-14 08:20:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So now we arrive at what I expect is the most common reason:   Would I use my Chinese name to let everyone know that I speak Chinese? That I live in China? That my life and career are China-focused and/or China adjacent?  I choose no, and here's why:
1426458710084251650 2021-08-14 08:20:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Am I proud of my name and so I want everyone to know that I have it? No.  A non-Chinese having a Chinese name is not an acheivement. It's not some kind of qualification or a credential like a PhD. I didn't obtain it via virtue or talent, like a prize or award. I just chose it.
1426458707630575617 2021-08-14 08:20:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Do I have a very long, difficult, or awkward name for Chinese people to pronounce ?  No, although I think this is an excellent reason for taking and using a Chinese name (versus using a transliteration). 2-3 characters is way shorter!
1426458705315307520 2021-08-14 08:20:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well, instead of directly answering "why not?", I'd like to instead frame it as "why?"  Do I have contacts on here that only know me by my Chinese name and this helps them find me? No.   Do I perform or publish under my Chinese name, so it's part of my public persona? No.
1426458703021056006 2021-08-14 08:20:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I identify closely with this name. I've been using it for ~11 years. I respond to it out of reflex, the same way I would respond to my English name. In life, it's me.  But I don't use it on Twitter, Facebook, or Linkedin (except for the Chinese version of my Linkedin). Why not?
1426458700491870214 2021-08-14 08:20:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW the Chinese version of that is how most Western celebrities get Chinese names, phonetically e.g., Brad Pitt = Â∏ÉÊãâÂæ∑ÁöÆÁâπ bu'la'de pi'te.  I would be Â§ßÂç´Ë¥π‰ªÄÊõº da'wei fei'shi'man.  But my teacher encouraged me to get a "real" Chinese name, which is how I ended up with ‰ΩôÂæ∑‰ºü.
1426458698084339713 2021-08-14 08:20:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I know the idea that non-Chinese have Chinese characters for names is already kind of weird. Scholars of Russia, Egypt, or Iran don't adopt Russian, Arabic, or Farsi names, to my knowledge (?)  In Japan or Korea, it'd likely be a phonetic transliteration via katakana or hangul.
1426458695538331649 2021-08-14 08:20:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First off, obviously I have a Chinese name, and I use it every day. It's ‰ΩôÂæ∑‰ºü if anyone is curious.  ‰Ωô is a homophone for È±º which means fish, from my English surname. Âæ∑‰ºü is based on Â§ßÂç´, which is how David is usually transliterated, but is much more authentic-sounding
1426458693051187204 2021-08-14 08:20:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> **This post is not about Chinese energy**  Why don't I use my Chinese name on my socials?  I've seen this topic go around a few times on Twitter and it should be self-evident where I stand, but I wanted to lay out my logic a bit more.  Thread:

I don't know if it's smug people are drawn to the field, or that smugness is rewarded, or that the community's culture is smug and they've adopted this habit to fit it, but it's unbearable.
1425861891033681925 2021-08-12 16:49:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome @blob_watcher lol @blob_watcher just as you praised me for not having a take, I went ahead and offered my basically unqualified mini-take anyway. Human nature perhaps. üòÖ. I'm guiltyyyyy
1425861115922182144 2021-08-12 16:45:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome @blob_watcher But that's just from mentions of EVs in those energy sector policy documents that also mention a bunch of other intitiatives.

1425860587498602496 2021-08-12 16:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome @blob_watcher Well my impression of the charging infrastucture is that it's kind of like "if you build it, they will come". Which China can afford to/is willing to do on a massive scale, and most places aren't/can't.

The bane of my life for a good three years.

I'm sure Guangdong's tight supply also affected CGN's reluctance toward an unplanned outage.
1425123908227788806 2021-08-10 15:56:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jm_desp @djysrv @FrantaJaro Strictly speaking, it's a trial price period going thru the end of this year, then it could be reevaluated. It's benchmarked to coal and Guangdong has just about the highest on-grid coal tariffs in the nation.  Not that it will help Taishan turn a profit.

So I kind of get why Framatome is being extra cautious and needy when it comes to this specific, first of a kind plant. But they still handled it poorly IMO.   https://t.co/nz4ZmqfzuO

You can't get rid of it by testing negative or by having vaccination.  SZ execution has been excellent so far but this seems like a weird oversight, to not clarify how asterisks should be treated.
1424650563308834817 2021-08-09 08:35:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Shanghai had 1 case in Pudong last week, and I have recent travel history in SH (not in Pudong), so my code stayed green, but got a little asterisk next to it, saying that I had been through a region which had a case. But SZ gov't hasn't provivded guidance on what that means.
1424650040308494339 2021-08-09 08:33:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Not entirely sure, since we have a grand total of 6 cases in Shenzhen right now, all imported, none of them connected to the delta outbreak stemming from Nanjing.  But seems this is coming down from GD provincial level, not SZ municipal level.

1423602304834359296 2021-08-06 11:10:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe Yeah Maine is one of just a few states that have racewalk in HS track and field
1423601135319863302 2021-08-06 11:05:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pajolicoe I held my high school record in the 1km race walk and took third place at the state championships.   I always knew exactly how it came to that: I sure wasn't making podiums in any other events. ;)

1423192860191461381 2021-08-05 08:03:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @lugan @QilinDelMondo @n1cholasr0bert @HillaryFan420 @china_takes You know there are lots of people on Twitter who actually live here right? Did you really count on not running into a single person who would call BS?  https://t.co/grsk6g5IpB
1423152976512700419 2021-08-05 05:24:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And a reminder to follow @LantauGroup for more Asia energy sector updates.  Even though they're mostly about China right now.  Which I draft.   So I'm kinda talking to myself over here.
1423152609691455491 2021-08-05 05:23:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So the benefits of higher power tariffs must be balanced against the capacity of the power users to bear the extra costs.  China's power system is "growing up" before our eyes. Ideally someday power prices will be determined mostly by markets. But even this is good progress.
1423152607913123840 2021-08-05 05:23:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Actually all kinds of positive developments can be achieved by the simple but very powerful step of raising the cost of electricity for end users.  It drives energy efficiency efforts and spurs investment in peak-shifting technology. But of course it can hurt economic growth.
1423152604981305350 2021-08-05 05:23:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For me, this point is the key takeaway from the recent new adjustments to China's Time-of-Use tariffs.  If you make power prices expensive enough, you create the economic incentive to change consumption behavior.
1423137884173856768 2021-08-05 04:24:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IESR @jokowi @kemenkomarves Thanks. I will check more of your publications. Are you aware of any other estimates of ID C&amp;I RTS from MEMR, PLN, or some international bodies?

1423111049784430598 2021-08-05 02:38:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The bottom half of the image is real, from a floating solar installation somewhere, just spliced together with the Shanghai Lujiazui skyline on top.  Check out the angle of the sun as it hits the Shanghai tower vs. the direction of the shadows under the solar panels.
1423110505133002755 2021-08-05 02:35:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Also if you think that's the actual color of the water in the Huangpu River, I have sad news for you...
1423110236533968898 2021-08-05 02:34:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Your periodic reminder that this is a photoshopped image.  There are no floating solar panels in Shanghai's Huangpu River. It is a working river. It is full of barges.  Keep seeing it in the presentations of people that should know better. This is from an IRENA report.üëÄ  https://t.co/d0jnZ8S3OX

I think quite a lot of people are shit, but I very rarely would publicly attack someone on my main account (I use my alt for that). But for him, I can make an exception.
1422066330778226689 2021-08-02 05:26:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere So I think the way ÁßëÊäÄ would be instinctually understood by Chinese speakers tracks pretty closely to how I would define a 'science and technology' company, in English and it wouldn't include Apple or Google.
1422065609601212419 2021-08-02 05:23:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere Although we now call computer science a form of "science", in my head in English there's still a difference between computer science and the science that's done in laboratories. Companies that perform lab experiments and research to create stuff are "science and tech" companies.
1422065249016897537 2021-08-02 05:22:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere Well ÁßëÊäÄ is not just ÊäÄÊúØ, but ÁßëÂ≠¶ as well.  I would call Apple a tech company in English, but not a Science and Technology company (putting aside the fact that we don't refer to any company as a science and technology company in English).  The inclusion of "science" changes it

1422019961250148353 2021-08-02 02:22:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wukailong @gonglei89 I think BJ is even worse in subway coverage. The distance between stops is deceptively long.  That's a name I haven't heard in a long time hah.
1422014248268431361 2021-08-02 01:59:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Every take that combines geopolitics and Olympic medal counts is cringe.   I'm begging you all to stop.
1422013194587959297 2021-08-02 01:55:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 I'm sure that's the main reason. The parts of the city I'm complaining about are pretty much all lane houses, half of them protected heritage architecture.
1422001517079322624 2021-08-02 01:09:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Suburbs are one thing. I was actually talking about some pretty downtown areas. Big chunks of the concession for example, are poorly covered by subway and just the worst place even to take a taxi.

1421697982664085505 2021-08-01 05:03:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Surprisingly large chunks of Shanghai have lousy subway access even with 20+ lines. Never used to bother me before because I had a scooter, which is the only reasonable way to get around certain neighborhoods quickly.  And taking cabs in this city is ass.
1421521875130224647 2021-07-31 17:23:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rnPhnomPenh Hadn't heard about it. Googled it. Looks like intended application is EVs for now. I didn't see any details about cost but if it can undercut li-ion with comparable performance, it's a pretty big deal.

1421460050866937864 2021-07-31 13:17:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 It's *so* frustrating for to spend a decade living in and learning about China, only to discover that the bar for knowledge is so low that even people like this are still somehow part of the discourse.
1421383908591996930 2021-07-31 08:15:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @HowardS15110279 No way man, if you were just a little more SECURE, you'd be totally cool with foreign media misreporting that your dams are failing, your people are starving, and your institutions are collapsing.   The fact that you don't just turn the other cheek to BS means you're INSECURE.
1421089231783571460 2021-07-30 12:44:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Considering this design serves as a reference plant for Framatome's other under-construction and planned EPR units, in France, Finland, and the UK, there may be concern about an issue with the fuel design or fabrication, or the plant operating procedures.
1421084191693840384 2021-07-30 12:24:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Breaking: CGN announcing they will be stopping Unit 1 of Taishan NPP to conduct maintenance and investigate the cause of the damaged fuel rods.    https://t.co/CB29LwC5Rh  Described as being a measure taken of excessive caution, as Taishan is a first of a kind reactor.

1421009826105069570 2021-07-30 07:28:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 I remember this starting even last year (or two years ago?) when the safari park in hangzhou was fined and reprimanded for collecting facial scans of park guests for no good reason.  If left unregulated, businesses were definitely going to take even more advantage....
1420958351987331077 2021-07-30 04:04:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang Bizarre that I know exactly where this is from a half-second glancing at the background
1420760020094836737 2021-07-29 14:55:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IvanPMasli I was referring to the CEFR and CEPR sodium-cooled reactors. The test reactor is in Beijing; the commercial scale prototype is in Xiapu.   The HTR is small, only 10 MW. But I believe the intention to is string multiple together.  Small nuclear plants can be tactical and cheaper.
1420754813273337858 2021-07-29 14:35:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IvanPMasli Yeah much too small for a utility-scale plant, although it's normal for an experimental test reactor. It's supposed to be a proof of concept prototype, with commercial-scale to come.   The Chinese Experimental Fast Reactor scaled up from a 25 MW prototype to 600 MW.
1420671150523228160 2021-07-29 09:02:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq Always so quick to catch the new regs!   Establishment of 20% higher critical peak price for end-users is good news for any peak shaving plays. C&amp;I rooftop solar, storage, maybe hydrogen.  Will have impact on Corporate PPAs too, as they are often benchmarked to retail.

1420621484599304195 2021-07-29 05:45:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @dlcmh @HSPekingpanda There's no particular reason to call it that, since it's common all over China. But there were a lot of laowai tourists who went to BJ and saw it there. Earliest mention I could find in Google was 2007.   It's supposedly now banned in BJ, ironically.
1420408228916064256 2021-07-28 15:38:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For the rest of the donations, we have found two families via our coordinator whose homes were destroyed and need help. I will try to get some pictures when we are able to allocate those funds to them, so anyone who donated from Twitter can clearly see how we spent the money.
1420407404261371913 2021-07-28 15:34:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Mr. Xie sent me this picture of how he wrapped up the boxes before he sent them from SZ, so I knew for sure that it was definitely our shipment arriving in Goutang.  You can see from the video background how many supplies are arriving from all over the country. Amazing!  https://t.co/Wu4BTY2u3X
1420406804522041344 2021-07-28 15:32:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Our coordinator in Henan sent us some pics and videos of our specific boxes of noodles getting unloaded by relief volunteers at the Goutang Village end.

1420355499522859015 2021-07-28 12:08:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @trublion92600 @gonglei89 "fate has found its hero" ü§£

That could work.  Actually I know France also uses large units for load-following too, although you're "not supposed to".
1420352100391817216 2021-07-28 11:55:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @trublion92600 @gonglei89 Hot (and only kind of joking) take: an SMR is a nuclear sub on land

1420285056677863424 2021-07-28 07:28:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattysino I think you have to go to the consulate for that lol
1420278947955150849 2021-07-28 07:04:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have my own opinions about this of course, but I'm waiting to see if anyone mentions the same ones I'm thinking of. ü§ì
1420275899107135489 2021-07-28 06:52:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck I personally didn't work with too many equipment manufacturers. My area was technical services firms (market entry to China nuclear) so I helped sell PRA services to the design institutes (for example to help them prepare for design certification in the UK).
1420275022069866499 2021-07-28 06:48:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Oh yeah I usually use the metaphor that car crashes are to coal-related deaths as airplane accidents are to nuclear disasters...  My point about dams is that whatever failure risk we can accept for modern dam construction, we should logically also accept for modern NPPs.
1420273806292131847 2021-07-28 06:43:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Now imagine translating all those into your second language and trying to sell them as a technical service to a Chinese power plant.
1420273510480375809 2021-07-28 06:42:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Aviation's combined losses over the decades may be equivalent or more....  But I'd submit that it's more appropriate to compare failure risk for nuclear to failure risk for other infrastructure where a catastrophic failure would be equally destructive, e.g. the three gorges dam.
1420271335452729347 2021-07-28 06:34:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck Dammit I was wracking my brain for 5 min trying to remember the technical term. Yes. Common cause analysis.  I used to have one of the top nuclear PRA firms in the US as a client in China. Super complex stuff. Common cause analysis for external events at LWRs is very challenging.
1420270477906300930 2021-07-28 06:30:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck btw chernobyl direct death toll was 52 I believe.  Plus 4000 or so excess cases of thyroid cancer over the subsequent decades, which is fortunately very treatable.  Those are WHO estimates. Greenpeace obviously promotes different and extremely hyperbolic numbers.
1420269746256154627 2021-07-28 06:27:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck And the risk analysis is only as good as its assumptions.  Prolonged loss of offsite power is one risk scenario. External flooding is a separate one. But I guess at Fukushima they were only ever calc'ed as independent events...when in fact a large tsunami could instigate both.
1420268653124067337 2021-07-28 06:23:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck For those that are afraid of such an occurence, no probability factor will ever be small enough I guess  Also the concepts are often way too abstract to be really convincing for laypeople. Like is it really more comforting to learn that the likelihood is 1/10^8 instead of 1/10^6?
1420248542883418119 2021-07-28 05:03:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @skkboz I'm sure way more people would be screaming about spent fuel rods at the bottom of the Pacific than are worried about them in the plant's spent fuel pool üí©
1420247784729444356 2021-07-28 05:00:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MikeFaganTaiwan @RichardHanania (The natsec angle, not the seismic angle. The seismic argument is boring).
1420247648825581571 2021-07-28 05:00:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MikeFaganTaiwan @RichardHanania You're right, this is a very unique and specific case for arguing against nuclear power üëÄ. Interesting story!
1420247282033651712 2021-07-28 04:58:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @skkboz NRC, for example, required all US plants to install more instrumentation to monitor water levels in the SFP:   https://t.co/Q2rsWa4m00
1420247043746897922 2021-07-28 04:57:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @skkboz In Fukushima, the spent fuel pool did slowly boil off over weeks with no offsite power and the water level dropped but never exposed the rods.  Still prompted a lot of plants to do heighted risk assessments for their SFP and add more measures to prevent a boil-off LOCA.
1420245049313357827 2021-07-28 04:49:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @skkboz The main concern for the spent fuel pool is a loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) due to earthquake or external event, partially or fully uncovering the fuel rods.   It's considered to be a very low probability event (USNRC cites 10^-6). SFPs have very high seismic requirements.
1420236507466452995 2021-07-28 04:15:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> P.S. Some wrong answers IMO:   1. wHat aBoUt sAfEtY?  2. OH EM GEE NUCLEAR WASTE  3. It doesn't make enough money

As a fan of nuclear power, what are the key devil's advocate points, (or at Richard implies, the "high IQ arguments") against nuclear?

1419906350583144448 2021-07-27 06:23:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq It would have been good timing to implement the Âü∫‰ª∑ + ÊµÆÂä®‰ª∑ on-grid coal pricing mechanism, except for the unfortunate restriction that the price wasn't allowed to rise this year!   We are predicting on-grid price will rise immediately in 2022, as soon as it is allowed to...
1419905476481806336 2021-07-27 06:20:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And yeah, obvious disclaimer, I don't actually know the calculus going on at CGN strategic leadership levels (despite living 5 minutes from their HQ), and the people I know there aren't nearly high-level enough to know either. I'm just thinking out loud here.üòé
1419905448686149632 2021-07-27 06:20:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If China hopes to export this design anywhere else (e.g. ARG Atucha 3), getting the statement of design acceptability from ONR is big. Even if Bradwell itself falls through it's big.  (While technically the HPR1000 was exported to Pakistan, it's not like PK had a ton of options).
1419905444798078978 2021-07-27 06:20:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In fact, my instinct is that they would hang onto their equity position in HPC, *even if it was obvious that it had become a real stinker and potentially loss-making*, as long as they thought that it helped them to have a better shot at getting the HPR1000 into Bradwell.
1419905440368914434 2021-07-27 06:20:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Those cost projections must be shocking for the Chinese side. 2 units for 22B EUR!   But actually I always felt the main value for CGN to be in the UK power sector was securing the precedent (and cachet) of GDA approval from the ONR for exporting the HPR1000 to Bradwell.

1419586173744205824 2021-07-26 09:11:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For the majority of countries, production of HALEU is a technical and [often especially] political headache.  It's not a deal-killer but it's a challenge that must be addressed. I think it's fair to call it a drawback vs. using 'regular' LEU.
1419586168056803328 2021-07-26 09:11:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A "breeder" reactor like the TMSR produces more fissile material than it consumes. But thermal breeders are not neutron breeders, which I mixed up.  The sodium-cooled reactor at Xiapu is a fast breeder. The TMSR is not. Nor is the HTGR.  This is wrong:   https://t.co/tOX3vuBLsS
1419586164210561034 2021-07-26 09:11:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Always learning!   A very good thread here from @ConradKnauer, correcting some of my misconceptions and mistakes regarding thermal breeder reactors (which the Chinese TMSR *is*) and fast breeder reactors (which the TMSR is *not*).
1419575865894064131 2021-07-26 08:30:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @janneblomqvist @6point626 Oh as a whole-system symbiotic approach...very possible. The breeders generate fissile material for the LWRs (and also act as 'garbage disposals' for LWR waste materials). I have seen some of this kind of discussion in Chinese policy docs about the sodium cooled reactors.

1419570723543154695 2021-07-26 08:10:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 You're right. I've conflated gas-cooled fast reactors and high temperature gas reactors here. China has an HTGR using a pebble-bed design with TRISO fuel. The value proposition here is not about fast neutrons, but high burnups and utilizing excess process heat.
1419567071587749888 2021-07-26 07:55:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 Are you referring to supercritical water cooled reactors here? I admit I know next to nothing about them, because it's one of the few next-gen techs that I don't think has an active pilot in China, which may illustrate something in and of itself... üßê
1419565753997488129 2021-07-26 07:50:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 But I feel China's energy security calculus is weighted  more strongly toward independence and self-sufficiency than many industry bulls account for.  Domestic scarcity of natural uranium is a real concern and the fuel cycle techs that bypass it get a lot of resources and love...
1419564976906276871 2021-07-26 07:47:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @6point626 Yeah I originally wrote that nextgen reactors would be the "backbone" of newbuild between 2030 and 2060 but rephrased because I felt it was too aggressive. There's going to be space for a balanced mix of reactor tech for a while to come certainly.
1419563396228259840 2021-07-26 07:41:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *scarce.   Dammit, there's always at least one typo.

1419553983480225792 2021-07-26 07:03:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @chinahelpdesk Right, molten salt reactors don't use water as primary coolant. Depending on the design, some molten salt reactors may still use water in a second loop (i.e. a two-loop design).  But I believe the reactor in this story is one-loop and thus would have much lower water needs.

1419533837072097281 2021-07-26 05:43:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Thanks~  "Worth finishing" sounds like I may have accidentally buried the lede ü§™
1419529249275346946 2021-07-26 05:25:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16/16  After all, Chinese nuclear capacity has to grow by 5x (at least) if the 2060 carbon neutrality goal is to be realized.  I simply don't see how that will be done with conventional U-235 fission tech. It will be thorium, or natural uranium, in one of these 4th gen reactors.
1419529247123640322 2021-07-26 05:25:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15/16  Does this mean China's done with Uranium? Definitely not, at least not in the short-term.  But I do think the Chinese nuclear newbuild between 2030-2060 will swing toward the nextgen reactors, less beholden to the import of scare U-235.  Pay attention, very long U bulls.
1419529245009670144 2021-07-26 05:25:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14/16  But starting up this experimental reactor is still an amazing feat. I will be watching its operation with great interest, as a commercially-replicable 100MW upgrade is expected to be built by 2030.  The liquid sodium reactors at Xiapu should be finished by this time too.
1419529242618916869 2021-07-26 05:25:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13/16  And some have argued that the Th fuel cycle in an MSR specifically STILL has proliferation risk.  It may be possible to operate the reactor in a specific way to extract U-233 that is not overly contaminated with U-232 (thus usable in weapons)...   https://t.co/VXHSfEFdzB
1419529237262831620 2021-07-26 05:25:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/16  Also like any reactor relying on fertile material, the thorium fuel cycle relies on a highly enriched 'firestarter' to provide the initial fast neutrons.  So yes, the thorium fuel cycle requires use of highly-enriched uranium. China has not resolved this constraint.
1419529234943332358 2021-07-26 05:25:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/16  Disadvantages of the thorium fuel cycle:  - Fast neutron reactors are HARD to design. Liquid sodium burns or explodes when it touches..nearly everything. Molten salts absoutely eat metal piping (corrosive).  They are super expensive when they fail:   https://t.co/iPPXvXxIDs
1419529232636473346 2021-07-26 05:25:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/16  Remember, China has relatively weak uranium reserves but a LOT of thorium. This makes leaning into nuclear a significant energy security concern. Replacing imported coal with imported uranium is much better for the environment, but hardly an improvement in energy security.
1419529230363230210 2021-07-26 05:25:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/16  Theoretical benefits of the thorium fuel cycle include much more abundant fuel and lower proliferation risk.  The waste elements generated (mostly U-233) are also much easier to deal with than those from the U-235 fuel cycle (Plutonium).
1419529228123467780 2021-07-26 05:25:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/16  Besides the thorium MSR, China also has a liquid sodium reactor under construction in Xiapu and a high-temperature gas reactor in Shidaowan.   TOTALLY different technologies and approaches, but all have a similar goal: fast neutron fuel cycles.
1419529225938239489 2021-07-26 05:25:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/16  Almost all next-gen reactor designs are focused on generating fast neutrons so we can unlock the energy potential of fertile elements like Th or natural uranium. Most nuclear power-using countries have at least one next-gen project.   China has at least three.
1419529223723642881 2021-07-26 05:25:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/16  Dissolving the fuel element into a liquid salt mixture to serve as the neutron moderator (instead of light water, as most fission reactors use) ensures the excess neutrons released during fission are "fast neutrons".   Liquid salt reactors are a pathway to "fast neutrons".
1419529221479665664 2021-07-26 05:25:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/16  So it seems our main barrier to using Th-232 as a fuel for fission reactions is....how to generate and control ‚Äúfast neutrons‚Äù to unlock the potential energy of Thorium?  This is where the "molten salt" part of the reactor comes into play.
1419529218891730945 2021-07-26 05:25:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/16  (For the physics nerds out there, there are actually two intermediary steps between Th-232 and U-233, namely  Th-233 and Pa-233, both of which undergo beta decay to arrive at U-233).  https://t.co/rzE6T3tiiW
1419528750597697538 2021-07-26 05:23:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/16  The Th fuel cycle relies on the fact that Th-232 eventually transmutes into U-233 when hit with those high-energy neutrons I mentioned (usually called 'fast neutrons').   U-233 IS fissile, and can be used for a sustained fission reaction. Presto, we have heat (ergo power).
1419528748068601857 2021-07-26 05:23:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/16  First - why Thorium (Th) and not Uranium (U)?   Th is more abundant in nature than U. In its most common natural state (Th-232) thorium is fertile, but not fissile.  That means it's stable, but it COULD be used to generate power via fission if hit by high-energy neutrons.  https://t.co/nDAMM4qbG0
1419528716284137477 2021-07-26 05:23:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1/16  A significant achievement worth noting - China is reporting that it has almost completed its first experimental 2MW Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) in Gansu.   This article has more details, but I will try to provide a layman's background too.    https://t.co/0w7q7w5YXm

1417718805162123264 2021-07-21 05:31:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SmartArseUSA @BadChinaTake As for overseas financing of coal, the BRI still has a few eyesores, but hugely reduced vs. a few years ago. The "Green BRI" push was really successful. It's not going to go from 100 to 0 overnight, but it's absolutely tacking in the right direction...   https://t.co/GEatObRihi
1417717704690049025 2021-07-21 05:26:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SmartArseUSA @BadChinaTake Solar and wind capacity additions under the 14th FYP will be much higher than coal all over the country, with most provinces adding none.  Given the extremely tight supply throughout the eastern and southern parts of the country, taking baseload off the grid is very difficult.

Not sure what else you'd expect to see.

1415370535672770563 2021-07-14 18:00:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sasperato Lol I used to live next to Manhattan in Shanghai. Got kinda messy on the street outside at like 2am sometimes.
1415322398702784513 2021-07-14 14:48:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I haven't been to one in probably 8 years? I'm sure these days it's way too smoky, divey, and studenty for me.  But I have a feeling/hope if I stepped into my local Helen's, I would find very little has changed: drunk students, greasy 30 RMB frozen pizza and 3L beer towers.
1415322396634931200 2021-07-14 14:48:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Apparently they're going with a totally different concept for their non-Mainland locations though. Supposedly the ones in HK are fancy, and the one in Manhattan just seems....very, very weird.    https://t.co/axJmTaffA6
1415322394529468421 2021-07-14 14:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The divey student bar chain with cheap beer and greasy food concept has created many copy-paste imitators over the years (see: Perrys, Ellen's). They all have basically identical menus &amp; decor.  Dianping says there are now 30 Helen's in Shenzhen, with another 5 about to open. üòÖ
1415322392553918466 2021-07-14 14:48:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In some way this reminds of the very similar story of Manner Coffee which @ruima has covered a bit recently. 2017 would align with about the same time Manner was getting its funding too...Another super cheap F&amp;B chain getting funded &amp; opening  hundreds of locations in 3-4 years.
1415322387281633281 2021-07-14 14:48:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Apparently things really started taking off for Helen's back in 2017, when some VC guys stumbled into a Helen's in Shanghai and decided to pitch the founder on bringing his chain into the big time to make it into the "Starbucks of the night". (lol)   https://t.co/HIKb9cYfCO
1415322382173044742 2021-07-14 14:48:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The Helen's decor was always super recognizable: all wood, strings of flags on the ceilings, graffiti on the walls.  I actually visited Sakura Cafe in Pingyao in 2011 on a student trip and went to the WDK Helen's a few weeks, shocked to realize they were part of the same chain.
1415322380038131713 2021-07-14 14:48:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you ever studied in Beijing, you probably spent some time at the first Helen's Cafe in Wudaokou.  Before the WDK Helen's was a predecessor: Sakura Cafe in Pingyao. Here's a 12-year old news story about the Sakura Cafe founder starting Helen's:   https://t.co/35dIBddHyb
1415322376305188870 2021-07-14 14:48:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Astounded to see recently that Helen's Cafe is going to have a HKSE IPO.  Even more astounded to see that it now has 350(!) locations, including one in NYC.  For me, and many who arrived in China around the same time, Helen's was the quintessential student dive bar.

1413764380278157316 2021-07-10 07:37:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Much has already been written already on the losses incurred by the politically-driven disintegration of these educational partnerships.  I have little to add in that regard other than my personal ancedotes. I truly believe CI resources helped get me to the fluency I claim today.
1413764378445320194 2021-07-10 07:37:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I have always told people that the Emory CHN  program is really strong and underrated. When I was there, the the department head, all instructors, even the TAs, were all native spakers with degrees from top teaching schools in China. I only discovered later how rare this is.
1413764376549498882 2021-07-10 07:37:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As an obvious example, we definitely enjoyed smaller class sizes because of the instructors loaned from the CI.  When I represented Emory at the China Bridge regional semifinals in Houston, the school was able to assign a CI instructor to give me 1v1 prep (thanks Ê¨ßËÄÅÂ∏à!)
1413764372644524036 2021-07-10 07:37:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Disappointed to learn today that @EmoryUniversity is ending its relationship with the Confucius Institute in Atlanta at the end of 2021  This CI opened during my first year there and I was undoubtedly the direct beneficiary of the extra teaching resources provided.

Less than half the price of Starbucks and still a bit cheaper than Luckin.

1408607633066532868 2021-06-26 02:06:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bassinfusion BASF is building a factory in Guangdong province which will use a lot of electricity  They found a company that will develop a green energy power plant for them (probabaly solar) and signed a contract to ensure 100% of their electricity will be green electricity from that plant.

1408603462548418561 2021-06-26 01:50:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bassinfusion The phrase is "enter into a contract". A fancy way of saying they signed a power supply contract with China Resources Group :)

1408418755621818370 2021-06-25 13:36:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero You have a lot more leverage when you're talking about offtaking *all* the capacity of a 100MW solar farm....  As opposed to being some light manfuacturer trying to score a slight discount versus the catalogued retail tariff.
1408418304054611969 2021-06-25 13:34:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero In this case, however, since BASF is offtaking such a substantial volume (or maybe even 100% of the generation project's capacity?), they were probably able to negotiate a settlement price very close to the generator's marginal cost.
1408417729086836736 2021-06-25 13:32:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero Older projects earning subsidies will have to give up those subsidies and go to a coal parity tariff if they want to participate in the wholesale power market.  For oversupplied provinces, this would lead to substantial discounts for end users. Not for net importers like GD tho.
1408396745650839555 2021-06-25 12:08:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero And China considers nuclear power to be clean energy, but not renewable energy, so it's not usually included in those metrics or quota systems.
1408396501873684481 2021-06-25 12:07:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FbmHero From the corporate perspective...whatever they choose. Wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal...  From the national perspective, China uses two metrics for its RE consumption quota system, distinguishing between Renewable Energy and non-Hydro Renewable Energy.
1408355952378540035 2021-06-25 09:26:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 17. A commentary on Guangdong's new direct power purchase rules for Renewable Energy - important for corporates.    https://t.co/jvi4YNWHRK
1408353498291343361 2021-06-25 09:16:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> BTW, for the quant minded, how much additionality does this deal imply exactly?  BASF facility contracted 245 GWh. If that was satisfied entirely with solar, that would theroetically translate into a ~100-125MW solar PV farm (based on GD solar irradiance/capacity factor).  Fin.
1408353496525541377 2021-06-25 09:16:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9.  So yeah, an industrialized, net power-importing province like GD allowing direct power purchases between end users and RE generators is a Big Deal.   Already, other MNCs in GD with green power commitments are taking notice of the BASF deal, and they're reaching out to us. üòâ
1408353494306721792 2021-06-25 09:16:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8. Previously RE was only able to participate in DPP in a few provinces, and in a a restrictive way, as summarized in this quote from a PV Magazine article   https://t.co/3CaZjeiTUX:  https://t.co/7j6mULxodN
1408353446718164994 2021-06-25 09:16:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7. Of course a few years ago, that would mean RE would be under pressure, as it was more expensive than coal.  These days it's competitive and even cheaper in some provinces. So participating in market competition makes sense now. Fossil generators will face the pressure instead.
1408353444939800581 2021-06-25 09:16:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6. Way 3:  Finally, it's also good for decarbonization goals in general. Allowing RE to participate in wholesale exchanges brings us one step closer to a truly economic power market, where the cheapest power prospers and the expensive power is forced to shut down.
1408353442989436928 2021-06-25 09:16:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5. Way 2: Of course it's also good news for the renewable energy generators. They now have a channel for direct access to customers that want exactly what they're selling. They don't have to worry about dispatch quotas or grid offtake risk etc. Guaranteed customers.
1408353441206849539 2021-06-25 09:16:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4. Way 1: Allowing RE to compete in a wholesale market gives end-users an option to prove green power usage beyond onsite solar/green credits.  They now have a strong CSR story to tell. They can point to a whole new RE farm and say "we built that".  Additionality is good optics.
1408353439436836869 2021-06-25 09:16:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. While it has been possible in China for end-users and generators to sign direct contracts for a while, RE has been mostly excluded from this, unlike more liberalized power markets worldwide.  Allowing RE to now compete in this way is a Big and Good Thing in 3 ways. How so?
1408353437645893636 2021-06-25 09:16:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. RE-DPP stands for Renewable Energy Direct Power Purchase.  Basically the end-user (Germany's BASF) has signed a direct wholesale agreement with the power generator (China Resources) to procure ONLY green power via the wholesale market directly from the generator.
1408353435401875461 2021-06-25 09:16:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 1.  This story was a Big Deal in China Energy this week and I didn't notice much chatter about it so I guess I'd better do a thread. üòé  China Green Power Procurement for Dummies:  So BASF has entered into Guangdong's first "RE-DPP." What does that stand for?

1407223449764827138 2021-06-22 06:26:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thinking_panda The China these 'experts' imagine to be so fearsome is an alternate reality constructed and reinforced via non-stop circular groupthink of broadly unqualified minds   You can't really blame them for not noticing their hallucinations; it's kind of a core feature of such a society.
1406982080144175109 2021-06-21 14:27:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kylechen_ @Silmarillion88 Haven't tried. I actually looked at some options for fun solar systems or toys I could install but I don't get much sunlight on my balcony and I don't have anywhere else to put it...
1406979793229291527 2021-06-21 14:18:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kylechen_ @Silmarillion88 Where were you with your clever suggestions 10 days ago huh?
1406970753698852871 2021-06-21 13:42:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattysino @FTX_Official Can't say we've done it before but we def. are equipped for it from the generation capacity mix analysis side.  We're APAC-focused so knowledge strongest for that region specifically (ofc including, most importantly, China).
1406905849092599811 2021-06-21 09:24:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kakajusaiyou @Silmarillion88 Nice little Xiaomi IoT ecosystem you have there. Assume you're controlling it all from your Xiaomi phone too?
1406903296837623815 2021-06-21 09:14:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kakajusaiyou @Silmarillion88 Yeah I saw the Xiaomi one just seconds after I made the order for the one I bought. Even considered canceling my order to buy the Xiaomi one, because I am a shameless fanboy. But figured it would be about the same in the end.
1406901862868000768 2021-06-21 09:08:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 Oh I forgot to mention it also started a huge fire in my AC. My laywer will be in touch üòú
1406900415489142795 2021-06-21 09:02:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you're in China, here's the Tmall store for the vendor. Looks like they also sell "smart conversion" devices for a variety of home electronics to make them IoT, voice activated etc. Not sponsored or anything, just cool.  #energyefficiency   https://t.co/R9QjGuhXPp
1406900411974381578 2021-06-21 09:02:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This works just as well for those of you living up in the northern part of the country, where you're probably tempted to leave the AC heat on all day while you're out, so you can come home to a nice cozy home.   Power prices will differ ofc, but the principle is the same.
1406900408396640256 2021-06-21 09:02:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well let's say I left the AC on at home for an extra 3 hours each day while out, to enjoy my cool home. Drawing 1250W, that's 3.75 kWh per day, or 112.5 kWh/month.  At shoulder residential power prices in SZ, that's just around 79CNY/month. Savings pay back in the FIRST MONTH.
1406900404713975811 2021-06-21 09:02:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And the price for my super-slick IoT AC upgrade? A mere 79 CNY (12 bucks).  Wonder how much of a premium I'd pay for a smart AC versus my cheap n' dirty dumb--&gt; smart upgrade? üßê  Anyway what does this save me in power usage and costs?
1406900400469340162 2021-06-21 09:02:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Here's the interface from my phone (took this picture right after I turned it on yesterday).  It even gives me two pieces of information I can't get from my AC remote: the current indoor temperature and the power draw in watts.  https://t.co/QU19iQEMwB
1406900393896910848 2021-06-21 09:02:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now I can control my AC from my phone, which is sweet for reducing energy usage.  I like coming home to a nice cool apartment, but I don't want to leave the AC running all day while out.  Last night I turned it on while landing at SZ airport and watched my AC work from the taxi.
1406900389727768579 2021-06-21 09:02:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So an update thread on this...I bought a smart controller for my AC, per the suggestion from @Silmarillion88 .   It was pretty easy to install...just plug the device into the wall and plug the AC into the device. Then you download the manufacturer's app and pair with the device.  https://t.co/IakJvRX6DL

So theoretically that would be the last *new* coal plants we'd see. I think the screenshotted tweets are older than the 2030/2060 announcement?

But that was pre CGN Entity List.
1405422931702784011 2021-06-17 07:11:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZichenWanghere Not to mention: it is my understanding that Framatome was hoping to consult with its own employees from the USA office. Which, of course, is a US company subject to US law.  They were asking permission to work with their own colleagues!

1405040863726604289 2021-06-16 05:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Final Point:  This press release is good, but should have come yesterday. EDF statements yesterday left us lamenting the industry's generally woeful lack of PR savvy. NNSA making a good and strong statement after allowing 24+ hours of speculation is only a slight improvement IMO.
1405040861759475713 2021-06-16 05:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> (Point 3 continued) These are indeed two very different things. Impossible if failure of communication is from Framatome, the person who leaked the memo to CNN, the CNN reporting itself, or something else.  If true, it's a very serious thing to have gotten wrong.
1405040859851083781 2021-06-16 05:53:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Point 3: NNSA denies CNN's allegation (via of as-yet unseen Framatome memo) that the "off-site dose limits" have been doubled. They state the doubling for the radioactivity level of inert gas used in plant chemistry procedures in the primary loop.
1405040857812639747 2021-06-16 05:53:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Point 2: An increase in radioactivity in the primary loop is indeed very different from a release outside of the plant. As long as that is the case, this is an operations issue for plant personnel, not a public safety concern.
1405040855879020545 2021-06-16 05:53:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Point 1: There are 5 damaged fuel rods in the Taishan Unit 1 core, in accordance with EDF statement yesterday and general commentary/predictions from nuclear industry tweeps. Well below design basis for continued operations of the reactor, so no shutdown expected.
1405040853886791681 2021-06-16 05:53:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Finally, a press release from China's NNSA out just a few minutes ago re: Taishan.

1404661230149668865 2021-06-15 04:45:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I predict EDF will have a more complete statement soon and this will all go away   In any case, a certain US media outlet wins a gold turd for their nothingburger of story, filled with alarmist, sloppy and innuendo-laden reporting.   #uranium bulls are feeling good today...
1404661228450897930 2021-06-15 04:45:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not clear if this is what EDF was referring to when they mentioned a buildup of noble gases, or if that is  something else entirely.  Also doesn't jive with the comments in the Framatome memo about doubling the radioactivity limit, (which was not confirmed by parent EDF).
1404661226051837956 2021-06-15 04:45:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> News article (CHN) from Wechat nuclear industry news account Ê†∏ÁîµÈÇ£‰∫õ‰∫ã about the Taishan story.   https://t.co/XhqXNdC2ZX  Focuses on an operational incident from last month, doesn't mention potential fuel failure.

1404445187078643718 2021-06-14 14:26:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hinds_sight Fuel failure mechanisms not generally related to the age of the plant, but instead fabrication defects, debris in the core, or several other far more complex core physics phenomena.  Fuel rods are swapped out when the reactor is refueled (18 month cycle)
1404442494251593738 2021-06-14 14:15:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 @aazz22100954 @energybants I worked with WEC several times at industry trade shows and pavilions but never as a client. They normally would hire big consulting firms and we were quite small. But many of the companies in their supply chain were clients.
1404437587154980875 2021-06-14 13:56:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 @aazz22100954 @energybants I spent the first 5 years of my career exclusively focused on helping Chinese companies source equipment, technical assistance, and operational consulting support from Western nuclear firms. I know a few things about China capabilities (and gaps) in this sector.
1404436794372804609 2021-06-14 13:53:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 @aazz22100954 @energybants It took an industry-wide effort and tons of money across multiple countries and companies with hundreds of reactor-years of experience to successfully implement the Fuel Reliability Program and get to zero fuel failures in the US. At that time, it was not a focus in China.
1404434266688155650 2021-06-14 13:43:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aazz22100954 @energybants They feedback was: (roughly paraphrasing)  "We don't have many fuel failures, we know how to manage them when we do have them, and it would cost a lot of money to institute a big program to fix a realtively small problem.‚Äù
1404427455788580870 2021-06-14 13:16:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @energybants In the past I worked with a US company that was very keen to sell technical services/FRP best practices to China to help reduce fuel failures but they didn't get much traction because Chinese side didn't feel it was a sufficiently urgent issue. This was a few years ago though...
1404423175123857411 2021-06-14 12:59:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 @PAstynome Hm looks like it might be describing something else entirely though. This wouldn't need Framatome to provide technical services.
1404387386000232451 2021-06-14 10:36:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Another good comment from Lindsay:   https://t.co/cHefd54EFR
1404384638869532674 2021-06-14 10:26:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> FYI about fuel failure for the curious.     https://t.co/cy72P1TvuH
1404380543660089350 2021-06-14 10:09:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Update: AFP has a quote from EDF (the 30% owner of the plant) saying there is an issue with noble gas buildup, which supports the theory of failed (cracked) fuel rods IMO.  Detection of radiation from Xe-133 or Xe-135 is one of the main methods for detecting this.
1404372983762743301 2021-06-14 09:39:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yurigrad @PAstynome The fuel rods for this particular plant were manufactured by the reactor vendor in France:    https://t.co/oQLfZocVCx  Nuclear fuel is kind of like razor blades. It's good income for the reactor vendor. China manufactures its own fuel assemblies for other plants.
1404372199734083597 2021-06-14 09:36:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yurigrad @PAstynome Yep, it's a undesirable but fairly common phenomenon. It's also called "fuel failure".  Here's an older, but very authoritative summary if you're feeling nerdy:    https://t.co/TpaNfRJ0QG
1404356694042300416 2021-06-14 08:35:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @peterpanza1 @PAstynome Can you link the NNSA report?
1404354401540755458 2021-06-14 08:25:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ReginaldJohnst7 No, that's extremely incorrect.  Probably don't try to educate me about my own industry Reginald.
1404351168822886400 2021-06-14 08:13:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ReginaldJohnst7 France.    https://t.co/oQLfZoux17
1404330707724345346 2021-06-14 06:51:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Sure:    https://t.co/kHXPMgvRmk
1404330492237803520 2021-06-14 06:50:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9) To illustrate that point: Compare normal plant worker dose per annum versus the dose level likely to cause an increase in cancer risk:   https://t.co/pKAMHre7cf
1404330490279063553 2021-06-14 06:50:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8) The article doesn't cite any figures for the original allowable dose level or the doubled dose level. So it's pretty hard to tell if its anything to be concerned about. These allowable limits are usually set super low by several orders of magnitude, though.
1404330488186032138 2021-06-14 06:50:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7) You wouldn't normally shut down a reactor and refuel for cracked fuel rods though. You keep operating, and do a bunch of physics calculations to restribute power in the core, and also redo environmental dose calculations. This work is *possibly* what Framatome is applying for.
1404330486126637058 2021-06-14 06:50:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6) As for why ambient dose around the plant is exceeding the approved levels, that could be due to any number of things. One or several cracked fuel rods in the core might do it. Cracked fuel rods are pretty common, usually due to manufacturing defects.
1404330484058923008 2021-06-14 06:50:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5) IMO, the technocratically-inclined nuclear specialists in the US DOE and NRC are way unlikely to take concern troll political cheap shots (unlike, e.g. the State Dept).  If they say that it's not an issue, then CNN et al. are left scrambling for innuendo to gin up concern...
1404330481282281473 2021-06-14 06:50:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4) So doesn't sound like Framatome reached out for *help* per se. Rather, they reached out for approval to conduct work to fix/mitigate the problem.  If there's no safety threat, as this paragraph starts, then the rest is just silly, superfluous, and alarmist:  https://t.co/PWgbIUsBVG
1404330431110008835 2021-06-14 06:50:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3) They're likely applying because either A. the information they are preparing to transfer originated in the US, or B. they don't want to impact their business in the US by doing work with CGN without full transparency. Probably both actually.
1404330429214203906 2021-06-14 06:50:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2)  Taishan is owned by CGN, which is on the US Entity List. Thus it would normally be forbidden to transfer US-derived technical information or data to CGN. A waiver may be obtained, however, for reasons of "operational safety", which is what Framatome is applying for.
1404330426823442434 2021-06-14 06:50:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A few thoughts:  1) Taishan is a Chinese plant built with French technology with a large French equity stake and Framatome is a French MNC offering technical services everywhere around the world (including the USA).

In SZ, apartments are just all encased in concrete shells. Was watching a USA home reno video the other day on YT and my gf was like "wait modern people build houses from wood??"
1403230278135345159 2021-06-11 05:59:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Even_Pay Wow that's pretty significant. Not likely to get much traction for floor heating in SZ though üòÑNow wall cooling, on the other hand, is something I could get behind...

1403228501155598336 2021-06-11 05:52:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 I'm very guilty of leaving my AC on when I go out, because I hate coming back to a stifling hot swampy apartment.  I would love a smart controller for my AC that I could turn on when I'm 10 minutes away from home. Of course I know smart ACs exist, but can I retrofit a "dumb AC"?
1403227992264888321 2021-06-11 05:49:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @johanstrauss91 It's a very rare Chinese apartment that has a clothes dryer :) In SZ the clothes are dry after 30 minutes on your balcony anyway.   The Xiaomi faucet looks neat, although water is very cheap already and I don't use much. I'm thinking about my summer cooling demand...
1403226936961167360 2021-06-11 05:45:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 I was thinking more in the cool new products realm. Search Taobao for the product ÁúÅÁîµÂÆù....trying to figure out how that thing works. Looks like it improves power quality by smoothing out voltage spikes, but I'm not sure how that would save you much...

Most foreign professionals under 35 probably fall into this category.
1402085150624653319 2021-06-08 02:08:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang @china_takes Yeah that's fair...the pandemic has probably resulted in net brain gain for China, although human expertise would never be like for like.
1402082902481858561 2021-06-08 01:59:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Mont_Jiang @china_takes That's definitely true.  I consider China my home more than anywhere else, so appy waiting out the pandemic here, living and working a basically normal life. But it's 100% true that the #s of professionals are dwindling.

The longer the pandemic goes on, the more people are forced to make hard decisions about their careers abroad. This is a weird thing to call a bad take.

1400980453788590085 2021-06-05 00:59:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Finest_Goddess I think we have different definitions of effiency
1400980118055448576 2021-06-05 00:57:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MandarinNYC616 Last night it was identical treatment to Chinese people. If you were on the testing list, you got badgered until you went, regardless of who you were. So I was nothing special.  I do get singled out for detailed travel history inspection at the train station though.
1400838515353554944 2021-06-04 15:35:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But while in line sharing our opinions of the community service center staff, I did get to learn the Chinese word for "sinecure" so there's that  (it's Èó≤ËÅå btw). üòà
1400838511478165510 2021-06-04 15:35:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well the testing itself was executed very efficiently...15 minutes in and out. Quick throat swab and that was it.  The Chinese people ahead and behind me in line were [like me] unimpressed with the repetitive barrage of phone calls this afternoon and evening. üôÑ
1400831230749200385 2021-06-04 15:06:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cagebird9724 apparently...
1400794203160907784 2021-06-04 12:38:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We're not doing city-wide testing in SZ yet, but seems I'm on a required testing list because I was recently traveling to another city in Guangdong, so I went though train stations...sigh.
1400792494132981766 2021-06-04 12:32:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> lol and now at 8:20. a call from the SZ city covid prevention office, asking for the same thing.  Seems they don't share any data with each other at all. 4 departments duplicating each others' work...
1400790694868840454 2021-06-04 12:25:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh and now the property management office just called to say that if we don't get tested in the next 3 hours, our codes will turn orange. ü§®  There's gotta be a more elegant way to do this...
1400790692985638918 2021-06-04 12:25:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Got calls from 3 different depts asking me if I've been to GZ recently, then guys came to door, asking to see my travel history code. It's all green, but they still want me to go get a nucleic acid test...TONIGHT.  Also called my landlord.  Effectiveness: 10/10 Efficiency: 0/10
1400135262936584206 2021-06-02 17:00:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattysino I understand approximately 1% of all the things from you that come across my TL but it's very entertaining
1400133770313830406 2021-06-02 16:54:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 It was like if someone's kids are crying or having a tantrum in a public place, should bystanders be able to go scold or otherwise ÊïôËÇ≤ the child, something like that. So it was a little more lighthearted I guess..
1400128884486463488 2021-06-02 16:35:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 Given the format where it often seems that they're purposefully playing word logic games to craft a debate position, I wonder if an improv show isn't a better comparison. Whose Line is It Anyway? came to mind when I was watching for the first time.
1400056657686654976 2021-06-02 11:48:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ArshKerdar @VlanciPictures @HuXijin_GT It's a Chinese proverb and if you have to ask....It wasn't for your ears...  Means pick a path through a tricky situation one step at a time, e.g. crossing a river while feeling feel for each unseen stone underfoot.
1400054287015632900 2021-06-02 11:38:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> "sit down, put down your phone, and enjoy the food".

Second is the venue saying "Glad you like the place, but we no longer allow photos while your food gets cold".

1399744409193705477 2021-06-01 15:07:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jyves1994 I remember asking my mother when I was a kid why we have mother's day and father's day but no children's day, and she very huffily replied "Isn't basically EVERY day children's day?"

"We know Starbucks has more money to invest in customer foot traffic research, but we think we have better coffee, so let's just set up next door."  In Manner's case, it's better AND cheaper.

A new risk for end users, especially large industrials. Good opportunities for load shifting and smart dispatch technologies

The second they figure out you speak Chinese, they speedrun past the boring conversation trees and want to talk about politics, religion, covid, nuclear power, the size of your penis...never a stale topic.
1398539900182429696 2021-05-29 07:21:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @SeanUM_China If I had a wumao note for every time I heard the phrase ‰∏≠ÂõΩËØ≠Ë®Ä„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇÂçöÂ§ßÁ≤æÊ∑±Âïä ËÉΩÂ≠¶Âà∞Ëøô‰∏™Ê∞¥Âπ≥Â∑≤ÁªèÂæà‰∏çÈîôÂï¶ or something similar....

1398204158025494531 2021-05-28 09:07:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Guangdong announced just last week that it's at risk for power shortages all summer, following similar notes from Jiangsu and Zhejiang.  Have to imagine the unseasonably warm weather this May is also playing a role via cooling demand.  Can't wait to dig into the data soon.
1398195093450858499 2021-05-28 08:31:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @miller_wf I think that, like most other disciplines, targeted specialisation yields more valuable outcomes.  Insectionality has its very useful place, e.g politics/law or linguistics/sociology but shouldn't be stretched too far.
1398186455017558018 2021-05-28 07:56:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @miller_wf If someone has spent decades looking at them, they're pretty reasonable to designate as specialisations, no?
1398185977613410305 2021-05-28 07:54:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hottakergeneral France is a funny example. You could speak 98% perfect French and the French would still be bullying you for your 2% of mistakes.

1398183690144870401 2021-05-28 07:45:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Oh btw if your stated 'thing' is "China" + "geopolitics", I understand you think you have a credible foot in a bunch of different sectors.  But since you likely don't know enough about any of them to be useful, you can only talk if you pay a fine first, like a bridge toll.
1398178379187179520 2021-05-28 07:24:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Nearly every Chinese person is more of a China expert than nearly every China Expert.

But it's uncommon overall, and esp. people who look like me are the *least* likely to be victims.
1393842924803170304 2021-05-16 08:17:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In my decade as a white male living in China, I can count on *one* hand the number of times I've faced race-based discrimination.  ..and I don't have enough limbs to count number of times I've been given privileged treatment.

When it comes to societal infrastructure, we are not a priority. But that's not discrimination.

1392800069414313989 2021-05-13 11:13:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Note in our forecast that Taiwan's reserve margin excl. intermittment generation is going to be below 0 for the coming decades. With RE occupying a large portion of generation, anything that affects baseload on a day when RE generation is already low could result in tight supply.

We're hearing that a high-voltage substation experienced a malfaunction, causing low grid frequency. 2100 MW of generation at Hsinta plant tripped in order to protect the plant.

1385442557824430083 2021-04-23 03:57:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A transition mechanism wtih both an on-grid price/MW *and* payment from the spot market is likely. This will balance investor risks and provide pricing guidance for the spot market.  It will be tricky to quantify for lenders, but someone has to do it.   Hooray for job security!
1385442555173621765 2021-04-23 03:57:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Certainly, some other mechanism like capacity payments would reduce investor risk, but many (including myself) are inclined to see capacity payments as a form of investment subsidy. This would be a philosophical step backwards IMO.
1385442552560504834 2021-04-23 03:56:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With coal's prominence in the system set to decline, the on-grid price must evolve. Mostly, we predict it will move towards a spot market, but that creates more investment risk than benchmarked offtake.  Either the returns are sufficient to spur RE investment...or they are not.
1385442549502939139 2021-04-23 03:56:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For folks on the generation/lender/sponsor side of the energy equation, this is a big question.  Thread: For years Chinese power on-grid pricing has been directly pegged to the coal offtake price, as it was the most dominant form of generation capacity in the system.

So if you have space and budget for ~12 panels, battery, inverter, you could do it.  x3 for the whole building.

Many provinces and cities offer their own subsidies, besides the national ones. Look into it!  Feasibility depends on your available rooftop real estate and power usage.

We'll see.

I hope this is carried out by IAEA.
1382656626021130242 2021-04-15 11:26:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zhijie78 So the logic *might* be: "well we COULD use it for livestock,  put it into the Tokyo drinking water supply or whatever, but that's never been done before and we would have to draw up brand new safety regulations for that. Whereas sea release...that's well-established."
1382655658411970571 2021-04-15 11:22:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zhijie78 I would guess because it's much more difficult to create regulations for something that has little or no precedent. Nuclear people prefer to be able to point to industry precedent for any decisions. Most nuclear regulation worldwide is based on how USA or France do things.

It's correct and accurate to hold them to higher standards now. I expect see to see stringent requirements for the third-party verification of the water's safety and radioisotope content before release.
1382650778343510016 2021-04-15 11:03:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zhijie78 Just to be clear, your implication is that JP is going release toxic water, on purpose, because they are too evil or stupid to process and and dilute it, even though they have the technology. And also that the IAEA is going to help them do it.

But TEPCO is saying they're going to filter them out. And we have the technology to do this. üëç

1381551817578848258 2021-04-12 10:16:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I didn't see any news on the dilution target they're aiming for, but generally a dose rate of 1 mSv is the maximum level allowed by public health authorities for tritium release.  Here's a fact sheet from the Canadian nuclear regulator:  Chill out!  End.   https://t.co/ZMZMj3F1mm
1381551814651174914 2021-04-12 10:16:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A CT chest scan will give you a dose of 7-10 mSv, (millisieverts).  A 1,000 mSv dose will get you pretty sick.  A lethal dose is about 3,500 mSv.  (That's about 3.5 million bananas).   https://t.co/7Y3Pdaf62Y

1381551808997302273 2021-04-12 10:16:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A short thread about why I am not concerned about Fukushima releasing waste water into the Pacific, nor should you.  Tritium is a very weak beta emitter and the water is highly diluted.  Eating a delicious and nutritious banana will give you similar risk:   https://t.co/VZoiKOajjO
1381543748971032577 2021-04-12 09:44:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MadamMiaow @skkboz It's diluted tritium. Risk to public is infinetismally small. It's only a story at all because the public is usually underinformed about radiation and gets quite antsy about this kind of thing.

1381131623203147781 2021-04-11 06:26:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HanLu45106232 China has plenty of its own issues with food quality (and safety) so let's not get carried away here. I'm thinking more about household consumer products, comparing Taobao to Amazon. Pots and pans, toasters, lamps, blanket sets, etc.
1381130379352887298 2021-04-11 06:21:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blob_watcher American consumers definitely ARE quality sensitive, but decades of dirt-cheap "Walmart pricing" has perhaps caused price-sensitivity to overtake quality sensitivity.  Decades of wages failing to keep up with inflation will do that to people....
1381129216729604098 2021-04-11 06:17:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stevemushero I would assume all the batteries in my house were made in China, regardless of brand.  I see things of low quality in stores, especially the small ÊùÇË¥ß places. But if I go to Taobao, search a consumer product, and buy the first result, I'd likely be fairly happy with the item.
1381127049193000961 2021-04-11 06:08:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stevemushero Maybe I'm out of touch when it comes to clothing. I haven't shopped at Walmart in a long time and my clothes here mostly come from the tailor at the fabric market üôÇ
1381126384483848197 2021-04-11 06:06:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stevemushero It's just bizarre for me when I look at product reviews on Amazon and it says: "typical cheap made in China product"   ...and I'm thinking "you mean typical procured by American corporation made in China product?"  Because Chinese consumers seem to have it better...
1381125690720886786 2021-04-11 06:03:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stevemushero Where do you do your shopping in China? I'm thinking mostly of consumer products on Taobao.

1381124087385219072 2021-04-11 05:56:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For decades American brands have been procuring actually the cheapest crap possible to stock shelves in Walmart, the bulk of which would never be accepted by Chinese consumers.  The brand would get torn apart in their Taobao reviews and go out of business.
1381122800564400129 2021-04-11 05:51:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Most Americans would be stunned if they could see the quality and pricing of the products Chinese brands sell to Chinese consumers.
1380807336411987973 2021-04-10 08:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq One thing I realized I totally neglected to mention is that this is still just a draft policy for open consultation, as you made clear in your thread.  If the FiT levels really are too low for certain provinces, we might see pushback &amp; adjustment now, before they are finalized.
1380800894451638272 2021-04-10 08:32:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *Technically a FiT refers to a special rate that is fixed by policy or regulation and is usually (when promoting RE) HIGHER than the market rate, or in China's case, the coal benchmark rate.   Getting ahead of any pedantic peters out there üòâ
1380799954340356101 2021-04-10 08:28:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd be happy to be wrong on this one, but my gut feeling is that these FiTs are a bit too aggressively low for 2021 and RE developers, especially private sector, are going to turn up their noses. Or get VERY picky about their regions.  This is not investment advice üòâ   End.
1380799948925505539 2021-04-10 08:28:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> We'll see when the new capacity statistics for 2021 eventually emerge next year. If we see a huge drop in new capacity additions, we'll know the FiTs were probably too low and revisions are needed.  Personally I think we'll see a YoY drop in solar capacity additions. Why?
1380799946215985152 2021-04-10 08:28:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Of course RE developers are not going to be happy with the new, lower FiT levels.   But will they be complaining because they aren't making as much money as they used to, or because they are now fundamentally unable to make money at all?  This is an important distinction
1380799943049273346 2021-04-10 08:28:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Some people might know that the REDF is in deficit now. This is because the # of projects that were connected to the grid and demanded subsidies was way more than what the fund could collect from end users.  This is also one of the reasons the FiT level had to reduce.  https://t.co/K5Ws0vpuYi
1380799936892084227 2021-04-10 08:28:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well basically, big industrial and commercial power users in China did.  The Chinese gov't created a Renewable Energy Development Fund (REDF) and collected a surcharge from power end-users to be able to subsidize the higher cost of the wind and solar power.
1380799934128037891 2021-04-10 08:28:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now we see from Yan's thread, the offtake price in some provinces is already lower than coal!   So who exactly paid to subsidize wind and solar and pusth them into economic competitiveness in China? Who was putting up the money to give to RE developers, hoping costs would drop?
1380799931317776385 2021-04-10 08:28:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The high FiT levels worked to push more developers to build wind and solar plants, which spurred manufacturing R&amp;D and encouraged economies of scale.  Solar and wind development costs dropped quickly, and the FiT level dropped over the years as well, to reflect these lower costs.
1380799928612450307 2021-04-10 08:28:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The important thing to note about FiTs is that they were MUCH higher than tariffs for coal generated power. This is because the cost of developing solar (or wind) used to be much higher.  For comparsion, coal power prices across the country these days are 0.24-0.45 RMB/kWh.
1380799925538054145 2021-04-10 08:28:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> FiT means Feed-in-Tariff. It's the rate that the grid company pays the generating company for its power.  These are the Chinese utility-scale solar PV FiTs for the last decade. The regions are determined by abundance of solar irradiation (i.e. natural solar resources).  https://t.co/6l9qNYGo4t
1380799870802403330 2021-04-10 08:28:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I'd like to use this nice news thread from @YanQinyq  about China's new Renewable Energy FiTs as a foundation to talk about amazingly quickly Chinese solar and wind power production costs have come down in China.  Thread:

1379006214105747457 2021-04-05 09:41:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy Every time my city gets large enough so that I'm really starting to be pleased with the scale and look of it, my laptop starts to feel like it's going to catch fire and framerate goes to shit, so I never really get to play a city for a long time...

1378945925209415680 2021-04-05 05:41:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @donaldcclarke So do your students learn this rhetorical style from you also?  Or is it more of a "do as I say, not as I do..." kinda thing?   https://t.co/PHBB9wKjiH
1378911598564106240 2021-04-05 03:25:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Eventually the plan is to have as many as 20 HTRs here, driving 10 210 MW turbines, along with the CAP1400s.   Together they comprise the Rongcheng Nuclear Power Industrial Park, fully capable of powering a medium Chinese city all by itself (see: Weihai, population ~2.9 million).
1378911595682615297 2021-04-05 03:25:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shidaowan also has the 2 pilot units of the CAP1400 reactor, which is a scaled-up version of the Westinghouse AP1000.  It's a 3G reactor, but absolutely massive. Alone, these two units can provide power for over 3M homes! (and that's at US power usage/capita rates...)
1378911592952127489 2021-04-05 03:25:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The HTRs originally were supposed to be built in 4 yrs, but were postponed because of Fukushima. The first safety concrete wasn't poured til 2012.  Unit 1 began hot testing in January 2021, so we should see operation later this year.   https://t.co/DVKkJjSRj7
1378911590196539396 2021-04-05 03:25:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Manufacturing the fuel...designing the components, ...everything about this reactor is more complex than 3G reactors.  But theoretically it can't melt down.  Japan and Korea have made a lot of progress here too, but US is at least a decade away still:   https://t.co/aGEt0XmJYY
1378911587491192837 2021-04-05 03:25:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Shidaowan is a pilot base for Chinese homegrown technology. There are 2 Tsinghua U-designed HTRs under construction here (Tsinghua has a JV with Huaneng).  These reactors are first of a kind &amp; very cool, with big benefits for efficiency, safety, and proliferation.
1378911584597147650 2021-04-05 03:25:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Sharp-eyed readers will note the report specifies this is Huaneng's first "pressurized water reactor" construction license.   That's because its first project *proper* is Shidaowan, which uses a High Temperature Reactor (HTR), which is totally different next-gen technology.  https://t.co/Mwd33GWOyU
1378911578662178818 2021-04-05 03:25:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Last week Huaneng received its 'driver's license' to build nuclear plants, specifically for Phase 2 of Changjiang NPP in Hainan.  But, this is not Huaneng's first project in nuclear. That would be the very intersting Shidaowan in Shandong.   Short Thread:  https://t.co/UUMbwLxSPz

I'd be curious if you could point me to the debunking of the CO2 emission quota portion (which was cited as relevant for Yiwu).    https://t.co/4GqNQAAble
1378665903072550919 2021-04-04 11:09:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blubberyak @hongfenghuang @chenweihua I don't blame you for getting the wrong impression of the situation though, since media coverage of it was really bad.
1378665549719203844 2021-04-04 11:07:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blubberyak @hongfenghuang @chenweihua But the brownouts were not related to fuel coal. There was a capacity shortage, not a fuel shortage.   Australian media ran a bunch of speculative reports but none of them were factual and the story went away.
1378627171720175620 2021-04-04 08:35:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blubberyak @hongfenghuang @chenweihua They aren't frequent, and they weren't widespread, and it was brownouts (not blackouts) for a few days in a few cities, for the first time in years.   But overall yes it's probably not a smart idea to talk about TX power grid issues if you don't have a spotless record yourself.
1378622880171261954 2021-04-04 08:18:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @Ash___Princess Yep.

1378260720161234945 2021-04-03 08:18:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy @bassinfusion I honestly have no clue...  I'd like to think their ideal audience is people like me or you, who are inclined to be sympathetic to their attempts to push back against Western media narratives. But that doesn't mean we have abandoned critical reasoning...
1378259416194031624 2021-04-03 08:13:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bassinfusion @stillreezy From a documentary perspective, I suppose it succeeds.  But if they were trying to reassure/convince their audience that it's reasonable and fair to give life in prison/a death sentence to people in a publishing house who published the wrong Uyghur folktale, this ain't it.

We have l√º and l√ºe, so why not the same pinyin for all phonemes that contain √º, e.g. q√º, x√º, and j√º?  Also -ien and -en would be more intuitive than -ian and -an I think.

China's PV and wind sectors have also realized true tech breakthroughs, but China's worldwide lead in these sectors has more to do with scale and less to do with technology.   Whereas with CSP, the scale is much smaller but the role is of true tech LEADER.
1372399495506325510 2021-03-18 04:08:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dragondescendan Interesting video, but it's too bad about the subtitles. They are accurate, but sooo stiff feeling. They take all the humanity out of the people speaking. You can feel so much more personality from the speakers if you can listen in Chinese.
1372396080013352962 2021-03-18 03:54:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @DanielDumbrill It's not as bad as the US, but I don't think geography is super emphasized in Chinese schools either (it's not on the gaokao, so...)
1372391351526952963 2021-03-18 03:36:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @DanielDumbrill At least they're both in SEA. If you haven't ever been to one of the countries it's easy enough to believe they might have a border...(of course 10 seconds of Google would also fix that).

The sensationalization and "bad other"-ing of everything China has real backlash on everyone that even looks vaguely Asian, everywhere in the world. Has this not been abundantly demonstrated over the recent months and days?

1372176101305249801 2021-03-17 13:20:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover That was in 2016. Post-covid, it's probably even higher. Things looked bad here in Feb. and Mar 2020 and a lot of people were negative about the gov't handling.  But then the West just did SO much worse and the attitude changed to: "well, in context maybe our gov't did well".
1372175049273188353 2021-03-17 13:16:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover One of many places in which I think China could do much better, and hopefully will in the coming years.
1372174652886327301 2021-03-17 13:15:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover Not great? It's not really my place to comment as I am not a member that community, but from what I've heard from friends who are, it can be quite unsafe or uncomfortable, especially as an activist. Something for which Taiwan deserves a lot of respect for being a leader in Asia.

1372170839815192583 2021-03-17 12:59:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover Maybe the experience of the average PRC citizen in their daily life, in their jobs, their careers, their dreams, their schools, etc. is different from what you believe is true?   Certainly there are unhappy people. But why can't most of them be happy? Their lives keep improving.
1372170362692149249 2021-03-17 12:58:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover Maybe all of them have received huge CCP bribes? I guess this is more believable to you.  I guess you'd believe that EVERYONE is lying to you and taking money from Beijing before you'd believe the Chinese people generally like their government. But why? Why do you believe this?

1372169021525663745 2021-03-17 12:52:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover And I guess you could say that they were afraid to answer honestly, except they had no problem showing their dissatisfaction with local government.  If they have problems in their life, seems they blame local officials, not Beijing officials. Which makes sense in a big country.  https://t.co/AAJNbw6jQs

1372166967486914570 2021-03-17 12:44:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover Well if ~92% think the government is doing a good job and are happy with their gov't, that means ~8% are unhappy.  With a population of 1.5billion, that's still 120 million unhappy people. You'll never struggle to find Chinese people unhappy with the Chinese gov't.
1372163127643578369 2021-03-17 12:29:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @meowlimeiti @TWFoodLover This one works for you too:   https://t.co/rEcC51JPVA

Or you're lying.  Same with this. You're wrong. Either lying on purpose, or misinformed. Sorry, that's the way it is. ‚úåÔ∏è
1372161020098007043 2021-03-17 12:20:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TWFoodLover Well because anyone who has actually talked to average Chinese citizens knows: although they have complaints and criticisms like all citizens do, their overall satisfication level with their governance is...high.  Which is why you'd find out too if you talked to them.

Usually pretty off the mark on China too.   But yeah maybe the State Dept. knows better than all those int'l health organizations and dedicated research scientists. Stan away, Watson.

1372055230691508228 2021-03-17 05:20:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW @steelmuslim Yes. Not only were they not near the market, but for almost a year now scientists have been suggesting it didn't originate at the Huanan market or even in Wuhan (but more likely southern China). And yet this bizarre red herring persists.  Also WIV is like 20 km from the market...
1372049288985931777 2021-03-17 04:56:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PublishingSW @steelmuslim At this point, according to the WHO, the focus of the origin shouldn't even be in Wuhan, but somewhere in southern China.  Which I recall is something that a Cambridge research team was saying as early as April(!) of last year, based on strain analysis.   https://t.co/3FjnhM5GGJ  https://t.co/hvY5clbrao

1372036862886342656 2021-03-17 04:07:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim ...when a Reddit-level depth of analysis along the lines of:  "guys you won't believe this....but virus from Wuhan AND there's a virus research lab in Wuhan?!?!?

Been in the industry since 2014 and they've been promising "8 reactors a year, every year" pretty much since that time...
1368841212078161922 2021-03-08 08:29:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq The longer term goal for 2030 is doable if they keep up with the new construction. We count 46 reactors across 20+ sites currently in project approval but not yet issued construction license.
1368839788950814720 2021-03-08 08:23:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YanQinyq There's 51 GW operational today and about 13 GW under construction. How are they going to get to 70 by 2025? We will have to see 7 more reactors hit FCD over the next 6 months...
1368820532552998914 2021-03-08 07:07:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In a world where we can't attend in-person industry seminars and forums, following both @derznovich and @laurimyllyvirta for insights on China's energy transition is a wise choice.

I don't believe the right mindset is to assume some outlet's coverage is *always* bad. Some things are editors, not journos.  But we must normalize viewing legacy media with a critical eye.
1367834077609357315 2021-03-05 13:47:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tanfongkee It's not impossible, but it takes a specific chain of events I think. These legacy outlets have so much accumulated good faith and benefit of the doubt. It may take *many* instances of catching mistruths and bias for the fog to raise. Then you start to see it all the time...
1367832583501848579 2021-03-05 13:41:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tanfongkee We see so much disinformation from Western media that we're sure they do it on purpose, but I really believe they are oblivious most of the time.

1366748224141238272 2021-03-02 13:52:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> As a conclusion, I find this article lacking in terms of presenting China's grid capabilities. It makes some fair points vs. the US, but its failure to compare or even acknoweldge its own grid failure of just 3.5 months ago is a bit tone deaf. üôÑ  Hit me up next time CD.  End.
1366748220852895745 2021-03-02 13:52:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This next point is accurate. Chinese end-user power prices are currently regulated. Either you have power and you pay the catalogue price, or you have no power. Power tariffs would never be solely determined by supply and demand.   Not yet anyway. Power markets are piloting now.  https://t.co/jcu61H0mAU
1366748211956752392 2021-03-02 13:52:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Chinese power plants are generally younger than their US counterparts and have much larger teams of staff available for inspections of critical equipment (assuming they have the appropriate procedures). I think mass freeze-induced generation failure would be less likely.
1366748206730649606 2021-03-02 13:52:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Now could 15 GW of power ever be taken offline by a once-in-100 years cold snap in Hunan, or Shandong, or Jiangxi? Maybe. It's subjective, but I do think Chinese power plants would have a better chance of making it through unexpected weather events like that.
1366748200158130184 2021-03-02 13:52:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Other provinces have more buffer against this. Guangdong, for example, has a good deal surplus capacity, sitting right here in-province, gathering dust. Most of the provinces in the N, NE, and NW are also locally oversupplied. So it depends on local capacity and connectivity.
1366748197289304076 2021-03-02 13:52:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Many provinces have razor-thin supply-demand balance &amp; limited import channels, especially in the East, e.g. Shandong. If 15 GW of generation suddenly went offline in Shandong, some lights will go out.  They could *probably* find more power imports elsewhere, but it'd take time.
1366748194395197442 2021-03-02 13:52:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I expect that if many GWs of generation were suddenly forced offline in Hunan due to a freezing event such as what affected the generation in Texas, the exact same thing would have happened.  It's not just Hunan that normally operates with a small power reserve margin either...
1366748191148761090 2021-03-02 13:52:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This regionality of the grid was part of why Hunan and Jiangxi had brownouts in mid-December. Didn't matter that there was tons of capacity elsewhere in the system. There was no way to get that power to where the demand was. That's not a "national grid".    https://t.co/4GqNQAAble
1366748187986259968 2021-03-02 13:52:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But this next claim is shaky. China's cannot meaningfully be both "a national grid" and also be comprised of "six regional grids". üßê  The interconnections between these regional grids are limited. Even interprovincial connections within the same regional grid can be limited...  https://t.co/7u7tnDpnAz
1366748177274048513 2021-03-02 13:52:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, this point about most of Texas being an "island" with limited connections to the rest of the grid is accurate.  The US has a regional grid system and ERCOT chose to largely divorce itself from the rest of the country to avoid federal regulation and oversight. ü§°  https://t.co/xrX1Ld7m4N
1366748159188246535 2021-03-02 13:52:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> An interesting "what-if" question, but not one that I think the China Daily does a very good job answering.  Let us take a more nuanced stab at it, by examining each of the major claims or statements in the article in turn.  Thread, naturally:

1366330864984936454 2021-03-01 10:13:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/12 Pumped storage and energy storage, in a way are kind of like the UHV lines I covered before. It's another tool power planners can deploy tactically to meet energy and environmental goals and in China, bridge the gap between demand centers and load centers.
1366330862275420161 2021-03-01 10:13:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/12 Meanwhile the image in the first tweet is of the Guangdong Pumped Storage Power Station, partially invested in by HK's China Light and Power (CLP). A quarter of its 2.4 GW capacity is sold to customers in Hong Kong.  The reservoir scenery happens to be very attractive. üòÑ
1366330859406565379 2021-03-01 10:13:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/12  The currently under-construction Fengning Pumped Storage Plant in Hebei will be the Largest in the World when it is completed later this year. It will hold 3.6GW of storage capacity, twice the size of the Anhui project mentioned above.   https://t.co/x3Xpwu9a0k
1366330856562823169 2021-03-01 10:13:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/12 -hydropower.org has an interactive project tracker where you can see all the PSH projects worldwide. I've linked it here.   Check out all the orange dots in China, representing under-construction projects especially in the NW, N, C, and NE.   https://t.co/3iEMeIwKaS
1366330853819736065 2021-03-01 10:13:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/12 Energy storage of all kinds is also used for other things that matter to grid operators, like frequency control and power modulation. It can provide emergency power during plant outages, or meet demand spikes during a heatwave. It makes the systetem more flexible.
1366330850804047873 2021-03-01 10:13:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/12 So PSH can be used to fill gaps for a short period. This is useful to pair with intermittent generation like wind/solar, or in place of gas plants to meet daily peaks.  Like when we all get home from work, turn on the AC, and start making dinner. It's called the duck curve:  https://t.co/CtZns64rdN
1366330833443807234 2021-03-01 10:13:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/12 China's most recent plant is in Anhui, completed Dec. 2020. 6 sets of generating equipment, each 300 MW, for a total of 1.8 GW.  Accordingly to Chinese average household consumption, that's enough for roughly 1.8M homes, for ~10 hours.   https://t.co/dp1oSHCDoy
1366330830746914820 2021-03-01 10:13:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/12 PSH also has disadvantages vs. batteries though, namely: high capital costs, geological restrictions and high ecological impact. It's also a little slower.  There's no guarantee the power to run the pumps comes from green energy, although this is true for any storage type.
1366330827458551810 2021-03-01 10:13:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/12 The major advantage of PSH vs. batteries is its much higher power rating and energy rating. It's a little less efficient per run compared to li-ion batteries, but it's comparable.  I'll talk about the other storage types some day.  Chart:  https://t.co/2bogkAMOWQ  https://t.co/qrWs4OxPRN
1366330821586546690 2021-03-01 10:13:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/12 So how do you recharge the 'battery'? Easy! You run pumps at night, when power demand is low and tariffs are cheaper. By the morning, the water is back in the top reservoir and the 'battery' is recharged.  Charge when prices are low, discharge when prices are high. Simple.
1366330818197549056 2021-03-01 10:13:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/12 Basically, a PSH plant is just two reservoirs of water, one high and one low. When power is needed, water is released from the high reservoir and flows down, thanks to gravity, spinning turbines along the way.   Once the water all flows downhill, the "battery" is spent.  https://t.co/imIBYnT6id
1366330811088203777 2021-03-01 10:13:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Power Sector for Dummies: Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH)  Have you ever heard of "pumped storage hydropower"?

Do they work or not? Authoritarian and democratic countries have both had success fighting COVID when they let their policies be guided by science.

That's what they did in Japan, Korea, Singapore Vietnam (also a Communist country) hell even Australia and NZ.   For 6 weeks we left our home once every 3 days for 10 minutes to go to the grocery.

1364293138924195840 2021-02-23 19:16:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Reasonable_Taco As for the urns story, remember that ALL funeral parlor services were halted during the city-wide lockdown, which meant that when funeral services resumed, they weren't just cremating the deaths from COVID, but from everyone who had died during that 71-day period.

1364118194479194113 2021-02-23 07:41:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Xanavi22 Yes certainly. Not suggesting it shouldn't be called out. More amused at the sheer clumsiness of it.

1363859100757450755 2021-02-22 14:32:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I would be happy to take maglev to BJ or SH. Normally these flights from SZ cost around 700 CNY early and as much as 2000 for same-day booking. I wouldn't think twice about spending the same for a 3.5 hour maglev ticket. Comfortable, easy, fast, AND zero direct emissions...  https://t.co/bLGedNuXYK
1363859082252226560 2021-02-22 14:31:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The article mentions that online discussion of this news has focused on that impact on the airline industry. Netizens point out that the option for maglev between these cities would likely be deadly for air travel and I totally agree.
1363859079009947649 2021-02-22 14:31:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The planning document mentions not just the 2 maglev lines but also 3 more HSR lines AND the under-construction Qiongzhou Straits project connecting Hainan Island to mainland Guangdong (!).  Of course it's also tied into the Greater Bay Area economic plan.  https://t.co/2nTHlWBYCn
1363859072672358407 2021-02-22 14:31:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This news got hot again recently when Guangdong Province released the public version of its National Land Planning document ÂõΩÂúüÁ©∫Èó¥ËßÑÂàí2020-2035Âπ¥, which lays out a 15-year utilization plan for ÂõΩÂúü aka "National Land" and references leaving space for "maglev train corridors".
1363859069916782593 2021-02-22 14:31:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The GZ-&gt; SZ trip would take just 20 minutes to travel 110 km. It would leave from Guangzhou East Station, stop at the proposed Dongguan Gedi Station Ëõ§Âú∞Á´ô and then arrive at the yet-to-be constructed Xiangmihu East Station È¶ôËúúÊπñ‰∏úÁ´ô in Shenzhen.  The line may also extend to HK.
1363859066863321088 2021-02-22 14:31:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This project was first seriously talked about last year, when the Chinese Academy of Engineering announced it was  working on route selection for maglev sections between SZ and GZ, and SH and Hangzhou. The latter trip would take just 20 minutes to travel 175 km.  https://t.co/WGcM0jgByn
1363859057065349125 2021-02-22 14:31:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> First, anyone who has flown into PVG airport before will likely have taken the maglev into the city. It takes just 8 minutes to get from the airport to Longyang Rd. station which unfortunately is still in the outskirts of Shanghai. That one is a "demo project".  https://t.co/QPeCi369qb
1363859038631436298 2021-02-22 14:31:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> According to this article, China is planning to build TWO long-distance maglev lines from SH--&gt;GZ and BJ--&gt;GZ.   Traveling at 600 km/h, it will take just 3.5 hours from GZ--&gt;BJ and 3 hours from SH--&gt;GZ.  I'll translate highlights in this thread.   https://t.co/xLGCRDz5sS

1363424711036706816 2021-02-21 09:45:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HappyChapman @globaltimesnews A week later, the brownouts ended, cause the cold snap ended and generation was able to meet demand again.   It was a few cities for about a week, two months ago. It's old news now. Unfortunately for Oz hardliners, China does not need Oz coal nearly as much as they wish was true.
1363423160016666626 2021-02-21 09:39:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HappyChapman @globaltimesnews If you want to know the actual case, and not just sarcasm: The Hunan grid is undersupplied and reserve margin is low. When the coal snap hit in mid-Dec, they ran out of generation capacity, and had only limited connections to other provinces. Grid management wasn't great either.
1363422422465093632 2021-02-21 09:36:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HappyChapman @globaltimesnews I mean, were you really imagining coal plant operators in Hunan, thousands of km from the coast, wringing their hands and saying "dammit, I just want to operate my plant but I can't find any coal to burn! If only we hadn't banned the 2.2% of our coal that we imported from Oz!"
1363420141753692163 2021-02-21 09:27:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HappyChapman @globaltimesnews Incorrect conclusions, based on poorly informed journalists theorizing about an event from two months ago. Sorry chief, that ain't it.  Every sector analyst (including myself) dismsised any relation to Oz coal and moved on with our lives. I know it's disappointing, sorry.

He told me in those days, the only routes that that were profitable in a revenue sense were BJ-SH and NJ-SH. But of course economic benefit =/= revenue.

1362607599061852161 2021-02-19 03:39:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GothamChess By contrast, see El Paso which had its own catastrophic infrastructure failure in 2011 and took the necessary steps to ensure sustained cold weather could never bring down its grid again. It's fine now. It's also connected to the non-Texas grid.
1362607225655734273 2021-02-19 03:37:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GothamChess Unprepared infrastructure is more vulnerable to extreme weather events.   Winterization of the generation assets and greater interconnection to the rest of the national grid would have mitigated most or all of the effects of the extreme weather. This is regulatory/infrastructure.
1362329704003297282 2021-02-18 09:14:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @blacknredcommie It's quite normal and encouraged to pick a Chinese given name. Picking a surname is a bit more controversial for some.  From a practical perspective, if you live here, many digital forms and fields for "name" only allow input for 4 characters, so can be good to have a CHN name.
1362317691575406595 2021-02-18 08:27:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 In consideration of the supply chain/IP/security implication similarities that nuclear power technology shares with commercial aircraft technology, I'm surprised the localization and supply chain outcomes have been so different for China.

1362060838803181572 2021-02-17 15:26:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ianjamesyoung70 @Zebraimage Many replies below this tweet in both Eng and Chn have pointed out:  "The English production team directly published unprocessed c-log footage"  Is a shaky explanation. At best, it's a bizarre video production mistake for professionals to make. At worst, a conscious choice.
1362029423071952901 2021-02-17 13:21:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ProfessorLogos Obviously not related to her tweet, which I think was pretty silly. Texas is not having a gas plant or a wind plant problem. It's having a "we don't know how to deal with cold weather" problem. Which Green New Deal has nothing to do with...lol
1362029015066767360 2021-02-17 13:19:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ProfessorLogos Well there's no reason turbines can't work in cold climates...they certainly do elsewhere in the world. TX power generation industry is obviously not experienced with cold-proofing ANY of their generation assets. Gas, wind, even nuclear are all out due to cold weather issues.
1362022374313324545 2021-02-17 12:53:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DrKinKam And have continued to extend those visas thru to the current day
1361995599877312515 2021-02-17 11:07:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @morrislolly Think that's where the argument has arrived now anyway. Not that it was a filter, but whether uploading non-color corrected footage for the UK version was an honest error or intentional production decision.  Many here disinclined to give the BBC the benefit of the doubt.
1361994652354707456 2021-02-17 11:03:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JDStringfellow If that was the intended argument, then I agree it follows a lot better.  I wish she had phrased it differently then: "Without taking steps to address climate change such as passing the GND, severe weather like what has caused the TX outages will become more common."
1361993385674874884 2021-02-17 10:58:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @morrislolly That statement doesn't help you...  "The yellow color was indeed a choice" is the key statement here.  He's saying they made a choice to publish washed-out footage vs. doing the appropriate color correction.  If you want to defend it, you need to argue it was an honest mistake.

1361984658985033729 2021-02-17 10:23:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ProfessorLogos Not really the key issue. No power assets in Texas are prepared for sustained cold weather, gas, wind, or otherwise.   https://t.co/ltqKEURRAX

1361984196588134405 2021-02-17 10:21:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cfmalloy It's mostly the gas plants that are down, actually. In Texas, they aren't prepared for prolonged exposure to cold weather and some of their components froze. Not a generation type problem though...it's a regulatory preparedness problem.   https://t.co/ltqKEURRAX
1361983373191770112 2021-02-17 10:18:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Non-sequitur fallacy.   Investing in green infrastructure IS a Good Thing.  But unexpected cold weather can take *any* unprepared generation assets offline, green or otherwise.  Gas plants failed because they weren't ready for the cold weather, not because they were gas plants.
1361978389410717697 2021-02-17 09:58:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 As for the failure of the gas plants (which appears to be the largest contributor to the power pool shortage) as well as the lack of grid interconnectors outside of Texas...well I don't know enough to comment, but likely lax regulation is to blame, as usual :)
1361977670691561475 2021-02-17 09:55:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Well for inspection of the exposed instruments, seems like the operating license (with NRC, at the fed level) required walkdowns and visual inspections to prevent freezing during cold weather. So that's on STPNOC.   https://t.co/sqyRzJ2Kay
1361974376996904962 2021-02-17 09:42:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 This blows my mindÔºö  There's no way we'd have open-air turbine halls here...and we have plants in Hainan and Guangdong with at least equally low chances to experience freezing weather as Texas.    https://t.co/0EzGgizzOL
1361973867930025991 2021-02-17 09:40:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 AFAIK it's been mostly thermal plants that were knocked offline, along with one unit of South Texas Nuclear and a few iced-up windmills. And it's not like windmills can't handle cold weather...they're used in ‰∏úÂåó. Texas's grid assets weren't ready for 1/100 years cold weather.
1361971784929566723 2021-02-17 09:32:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Well, if it happens in the USA, it's a learning opportunity to take climate change seriously.   But if it happens in China, it's China experiencing the backlash of its own shortsighted, failed policies. üßê
1361964000292954113 2021-02-17 09:01:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zebraimage The most annoying part is the smug arrogance, as if they're in on a joke and everyone else is too dumb to get it.   It's a defense for being caught in some BS. They have to double down and act like the other side is craaazy for suggesting it's weird/suspicious. Pure gaslighting.

1361684780165734400 2021-02-16 14:32:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> See the Chinese provincial targets for 2020 (versus 2018 numbers). Bold signifies instances where the province had already exceeded their RPS goal early.  Most were there or almost there, 2 years in advance. Good on them, but maybe it means the targets weren't strict enough...?  https://t.co/6aUcKLDxUG
1361682535437139972 2021-02-16 14:23:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is *very* important.   Provincial renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goals drive a lot of other things.  The last round of goals meant to be hit by 2021 were insufficiently strict. Many had already reached their targets by 2018.  40% by 2030 is more ambitious but doable IMO.

Dialect appears to be an imprecise translation for ÊñπË®Ä, but we lack more accurate vocabulary. I've seen some writers even prefer to use 'fangyan' in English to avoid this issue.üòâ
1360104516360671237 2021-02-12 05:52:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 @linguini_anthro That said, are Western linguists in fact more aligned with Chinese linguists on the distinction between dialect and language? Considering the vastly different cultural histories and traditions, I would guess there's still a division. It's not a universal science like physics...
1360103825995014145 2021-02-12 05:49:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 @linguini_anthro Right, I agree that the author might have set up a strawman by representing the "western layperson" view as the "western academic" view. As a layperson myself, I missed the distinction. If we want to look at the question fairly, we should represent the position fairly.
1360096522302488576 2021-02-12 05:20:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @anaizxy Like of course accent and dialect mean different things, in both English and Chinese, from a pure linguistics or dictionary approach. But most of us who are not linguists probably use them imprecisely...
1360095775334699008 2021-02-12 05:17:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 @linguini_anthro I'm not coming at it from a political view (and yes ofc some are). My "Western lay" perspective on "dialects" is that they are mutually intelligible. It sounds like Western academics would disagree which is fine.   BUT my lay perspective came from somewhere, right?
1360094917788270592 2021-02-12 05:14:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fanyiyi33 @linguini_anthro I think the so-called "Western academic" column could more accurately be called as the "Western layperson" column. A student of languages but *not* linguistics (like me!) listens to Cantonese (which I don't speak) vs. Mandarin (which I do) and says "how is that a dialect!?" But,
1360093983871934470 2021-02-12 05:10:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @anaizxy The author chose the approach: "ÊñπË®Ä = dialect but they mean different things".  You'd have to make up a new Eng. word that better captures the Chn. meaning of ÊñπË®Ä  Chinese phrasing that better captures the Eng. meaning of "dialect" maybe is like Âú∞ÊñπÂè£Èü≥ or Âú∞ÊñπËÖî , not ÊñπË®Ä
1360091181351272451 2021-02-12 04:59:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @anaizxy According to "Western academic" definition in the table, are they not mutually unintelligible? Which makes them (again by that definition) *not* dialects of each other?

China was getting some anthracite (aka brown coal) from Oz, which is a major producer of it. It's replaced the Oz stuff with imports of Indonesian anthracite instead. Chinese coal generally is the more low quality stuff.

My gf's hometown is a 4th-tier city in Hubei. It's just *now* starting its growth boom that ‰∏ÄÁ∫ø saw 25 years ago and Êñ∞‰∏ÄÁ∫ø saw 10-15 years ago.

1356949526485954561 2021-02-03 12:55:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Not that export track record is *everything*. The UAE bought its first-ever reactors from South Korea, who were also exporting their tech for the first time, for instance.   But it really, really helps.
1356949237599100949 2021-02-03 12:54:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And it's kind of funny to think of Russia having a geopolitical edge over China when it comes to nuclear exports, but Rosatom has been absolutely stacking up the orders in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Their technical track record is also much stronger.
1356948143657476098 2021-02-03 12:50:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 No doubt - domestic build outlook is very strong and CGN and CNNC aren't suffering for work.  But they'd *love* to export them too. It's prestige tech, it's part of MIC 2025, was a cornerstone of Ëµ∞Âá∫Âéª and the ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂêçÁâá before that.
1356947089079504899 2021-02-03 12:46:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> I call RU and SK true competitors, by the way, because they're the only others that offer good financing options. USA/France/Japan just aren't competing in that way.  Also China's friends are mostly not technologically ready to build. Developing a nuclear industry takes decades.
1356945799851110401 2021-02-03 12:41:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have watched the CHN nuclear export effort with doubt for years. Not that the tech has problems, but that China's true competitors for nuclear power exports (Russia and SK) usu. have geopolitics on their side.  Countries that get along best with CHN usually can't afford nuclear.

It's the field of Chinese power system planning, policy, supply, demand, and power pricing. A field that happens to be of great interest to my employer and our clients, and is literally what I do for work all day long.
1356614848377880577 2021-02-02 14:45:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @frontwheelskid As for reporting on BJ outages, I searched both foreign and local media and only found one RFA article about areas in BJ cutting power briefly for grid maintenance. Other power cuts were widely reported. seems unlikely there's much more to that story.  https://t.co/feKCnzQC0t
1356614480835280897 2021-02-02 14:44:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @frontwheelskid But also just from a commodities trading perspective, the idea that China would be unable to replace its small Oz coal imports by re-opening domestic mines and importing more lignite from Indonesia is pretty unbelievable.

1356614304447950851 2021-02-02 14:43:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @frontwheelskid The reason it's old news it because there hasn't been any power rationing since December 19. Local and international media covered it in depth and the NDRC issued a formal statement.    https://t.co/4GqNQAAble
1356614184969134085 2021-02-02 14:43:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @frontwheelskid Beijing hasn't used coal for power for over three years. Due to the record high heat demand at the end of December and gas shortage (BJ uses gas for heating), several mothballed plants were restarted for a short while.  Tough to do if you're out of coal.   https://t.co/iEEPZsyGsV
1356587887546957825 2021-02-02 12:58:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @frontwheelskid Regardless of whether or Beijing actually had an outage (and I'd be fascinated to hear the date, time, and duration of supposed blackout, and whether it was planned or not), it's not related to Oz coal, which was less than 3% of China's imports. This is very old news.

1356581395993255937 2021-02-02 12:33:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanattrill Fitch is less optimistic. Domestic miners and Indonesian exporters most likely to benefit from the near-term demand and price spikes.   https://t.co/OfBZrLXUmJ

1355724510779961345 2021-01-31 03:48:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WayneH87 @Alsadius @YearCovid 'Concentration camp' invokes a specific image of WW2 Nazi Germany and that's precisely that China's critics are hoping for.  I think the social engineering that appears to be going on there is icky. I don't support. But it's a far cry from Zyklon B showers and mass graves...

I suppose you also believe that China is suffering from a famine and the Three Gorges Dam is about to collapse? And minority languages are disappearing?
1355721925956231176 2021-01-31 03:37:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Alsadius @WayneH87 @YearCovid If you went to HK there and walked around, you would see 1C2S is very much alive and well. The idea that China "owes" something to its colonizer is quite funny.  The two Michaels' detention is pretty murky so it's hard to say. You certainly don't know though.

There was a period when the existence of the camps was denied, but that was several years ago. These days, the Chinese government calls them re-education camps and its critics call them concentration camps.

1354469801972785153 2021-01-27 16:42:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 19/18 Bonus joke if you read this far:  The most common radioisotope in healthcare is a small device that contains Technetium-99, which slowly decays into Molybdenum-99 to be extracted and used.  This Mo-99 generator in the industry is often called a "moly cow".  I kid you not.
1354469799141642241 2021-01-27 16:42:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 18/18 China is hoping to build a huge reprocessing facility with France, which would be a fuel cycle closeout solution.  The negotiation process has taken ages and very delayed. It took a decade to sign MOU and still no construction. But that's the plan.   https://t.co/81eylpVlWS
1354469796474048515 2021-01-27 16:42:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 17/18 China has a thriving radioisotope industry which is growing rapidly as many Western countries have moved away from nuclear power and shut down their reactors that were producing a lot of the world's supply, especially Canada. Russia is also big.
1354469792443363331 2021-01-27 16:42:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 16/18 Various fission products can also used in healthcare (cancer treatment) or have industrial applications.   Any fissile materials could be removed and made into fresh fuel.  New gen reactors can burn almost anything. As can Canadian-designed CANDUs.   https://t.co/SUoI8VDCUg
1354469786709749761 2021-01-27 16:42:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15/18 For instance Pu-238 is used by NASA as a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) for deep space. Remember that scene in The Martian where Matt Damon uses it for heat? Yes that's real and accurate!  The USA is out of it, so we buy from Russia.   https://t.co/puQTgCQDnm  https://t.co/fGGvXBlSGg
1354469778694410241 2021-01-27 16:42:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14/18 If you have 'closed fuel cycle', it means you try to reprocess the waste into something useful. But it's an expensive process to do safely. France does this (for most of EU too). China wants to also.  Some of those fission products are super rare and valuable, after all.
1354469775875796992 2021-01-27 16:42:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13/18 Its eventual fate depends on whether your country has policy of open fuel cycle' or 'closed fuel cycle'.  If you have open fuel cycle, you basically don't have a plan. You store it in casks and your gov't fights over where to put it. (e.g. the USA)   https://t.co/sNpz7vAnl5.
1354469772927229952 2021-01-27 16:42:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/18  SO.  All this stuff is in the waste when it comes out of the reactor. What can we do with it? Basically, we stick it in cold water. This is called the spent fuel pool in a nuke plant. We wait for the most aggressive elements to decay and heat to partly dissipate...  https://t.co/uHBNIrNL7I
1354469767097114626 2021-01-27 16:42:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/18 Plutonium-239 is a major problematic component of SNF, because it decays with radiation and also has a half-life of 40,000 years.  It only emits alpha particles though, so you'd need to breathe it in to cause health issues. Not as dangerous as beta or gamma particles...
1354469764010131456 2021-01-27 16:42:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/18 Sometimes the U-238 can also pick up free electrons in the fission process. It doesn't split apart. Instead it gets BIGGER, creating a 'transuranic' element, i.e. something BEYOND uranium on the elemental table. Like Neptunium, Plutonium, Neptunium, Curium, etc...  https://t.co/TDeg8otRJr
1354469758175834118 2021-01-27 16:42:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/18 Iodine-131 doesn't have a long half life, but is absorbed and stored in the thyroid gland if we are exposed. It causes the metallic air taste reported by many Chernobyl first responders. It also causes thyroid cancer, fortunately very treatable.    https://t.co/Y7nllZBaqh
1354469753067171842 2021-01-27 16:42:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/18 Fission products like these are especially dangerous because they are in the 'Goldilocks zone' of high radiation levels AND relatively long half-lives (i.e. they are dangerous to be around AND they take a long time to decay into safe, inert elements).  There's also I-131.
1354469750378663937 2021-01-27 16:42:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/18 Back to the main point. U-235 and U-238 went in, but a nasty cocktail of radioactive materials came out.  Fission products were created by the splitting of U-235 into two smaller elements (while releasing energy). Some of them are very bad, like Sr-90 or Ce-137.
1354469747576852483 2021-01-27 16:42:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/18 (Side note: the U-238 removed during enrichment is called 'tails' or 'depleted uranium'. It's very dense but still mildly radioactive, so it has limited uses. The US military used it for ammo, where it had horrible long-term health effects in Iraq).   https://t.co/j89LCcOWFN
1354469744611528714 2021-01-27 16:42:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/18 Anyway when the fuel went in, the pellets were made of two isotopes of Uranium: U-235 and U-238. The U-238 is almost inert, but the U-235 is fissile.  Uranium in nature only contains a tiny % of U-235. Enrichment removes U-238 and raises the relative concentration of U-235.
1354469740752695298 2021-01-27 16:42:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/18 So when those assemblies are removed, this is our 'SNF'. What is it exactly?   Basically it's a chunk of various elements, many of them radioactive. The exact composition changes, because fission yield is random (but on a bimodal curve). This is too nerdy for today.
1354469737753759750 2021-01-27 16:42:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/18 Those fuel rods are packed together into a bundle called a fuel assembly. Different reactors have different #'s of assemblies. The CNNC-designed Hualong One at Fuqing 5 has 177.. Reactors usually swap about 1/3rd of their fuel assemblies during a fuel reload.  https://t.co/LG66KA0UJx
1354469729583255552 2021-01-27 16:42:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/18 Simply put, SNF is what comes out of a nuclear reactor using fission to generate heat (that heats water to steam to turn a turbine for power).  When the fuel went into the reactor, it started out as pellets of uranium oxide packed into a long thin clad of zirconium alloy.  https://t.co/ehnWcQrOxG
1354469278368505856 2021-01-27 16:40:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Let's talk about nuclear waste, because why the hell not? (Thread 1/18)  (I know I said my next thread would be be about storage, but it's a huge topic that will take much time).  The most important nuclear waste is Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF).

This is not reasonable or scientific. Read the room. Your commentary was tone-deaf in the extreme.

1352487057902301186 2021-01-22 05:23:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim The foreigners they normally see here are the types that go on TV shows to sing Chinese songs and act in skits. If I talked about anything nuanced, some viewers would get angsty. And Mi Live would send me messages warning me to avoid sensitive topics.
1352486139832143879 2021-01-22 05:19:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim I flirted with livestreaming in China for a while and quickly amassed 14k followers on Mi Live (which is all but defunct these days), almost certainly because of the novelty of being a white guy speaking Chinese.

The subsidy pool for newbuild in RE in 2020 was pretty small. Most of this was grid-parity.

1350753260181700611 2021-01-17 10:34:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha So to my eyes, it's a pretty artificial barrier, that turns away those less technologically sophisticated, with lower levels of education, less globalized, while posing little obstruction to those who really want to access the outside web. A passive filtration system.
1350751937390551042 2021-01-17 10:28:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha After all, the Great Firewall is truly quite porous, if you're determined enough to get around it. It's not an impenetrable wall...more like an inconvenience. And for the vast majority of those that circumvent it and go on to use it in legally benign ways, no penalty awaits.
1350751447437041668 2021-01-17 10:26:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha Some who are pro-China agree with that explanation and also agree with its implementation, on the grounds that it promotes social stability and creates more benefit than damage. Others (including myself) think it's more complex than just about "controlling the narrative".
1350749432833196032 2021-01-17 10:18:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha And, as a bit of a side item, there is the question about *why* internet censorship exists in China. The convenient explanation from outside China is usually that Beijing wants to be able to control media consumption and therefore historical and societal narratives.
1350747792747110402 2021-01-17 10:12:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha As for state media workers, I have no idea what the arrangement is. Certainly using foreign social media on a VPN provides an outlet to express ideas more freely than they could in their own media, although it's likely na√Øve to assume they are free to post *whatever* they want.
1350746575283228672 2021-01-17 10:07:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha I'd say virtually all foreigners living and working in China use a VPN to access the 'outside' web without repercussions, as do the great bulk of Chinese VPN users, which some estimates I've seen have placed as high as 10% of all Chinese internet users. Penalties *very* rare.
1350745890256871425 2021-01-17 10:04:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha Thus in the very infrequent occasions we hear of some criminal prosecution for VPN usage, it usually is linked to the nature of the activities conducted while using the VPN. Most often cited that I've read of heard of are online gambling and distribution of pornography.
1350745272511389699 2021-01-17 10:02:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha After all a ton of businesses, financial institutions, universities, etc. need to use VPN software to access a bunch of foreign websites that are blocked by the 'Great Firewall', things sometimes as benign as foreign university or bank websites. Never mind social media.
1350744672637841408 2021-01-17 10:00:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha *Distribution* of VPN software appears to be more unambiguously illegal terms and there are prosecutions (albeit very rare) on record for distribution of VPN software. It's a bit different for *using* a VPN though.
1350744441590476806 2021-01-17 09:59:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha So using Twitter itself is not illegal, as is commonly (and incorrectly) cited. But it *is* unavailable without usage of a VPN.  So then is usage of a VPN illegal? This is more complicated and seems to vary by region.
1350744344488099841 2021-01-17 09:58:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rolandsabin @MarlboroughJE @karl_zha I somehow doubt you asked this question in good faith, but I'll respond anyway so I can QT it in the future when I get similar questions.   China blocks access to Twitter by having the three major ISPs (Mobile, Unicom, Telecom) block access to all of Twitter's data servers.

1349982403494699009 2021-01-15 07:31:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Getting China to not build coal doesn't help these countries get the power they need. It's not like someone else is gonna swoop in and build a clean power instead. They'll just continue to suffer from insufficient power.   Capacity building to improve RE bankability is key. 4/4
1349982398516105217 2021-01-15 07:30:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China is totally willing to invest in renewable projects that have bankable conditions like solid PPAs, clear land usage laws, stable power tariffs, some type of sovereign guarantees, etc. But reality is, most BRI countries are weak on these. Coal is easy &amp; BANKABLE. 3/4
1349982395974381569 2021-01-15 07:30:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Renewables, like any other power project, should be profitable, and financiers need to be convinced that the project has a good chance of making the developer enough money to pay back their loans. Developing countries often can only offer weak conditions for RE financing. 2/4
1349982392639909889 2021-01-15 07:30:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's not useful to lay blame for financing of carbon-intense projects in BRI exclusively at China's feet.  Responsibility lies both with China to be a responsible investor and with recipient countries to take steps to create more RE projects and improve their bankability. 1/4

This is much more complex than "Chinese people don't tell the whiteys how they REALLY feel" and your comment is a dog whistle to that effect.

1348692370796154881 2021-01-11 18:04:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo @gonglei89 From a rhetorical standpoint, I agree with that aspect of your critique.  "It's not appropriate for China to be characterized as fascist if the majority of the population is happy and optimistic".  My non-sequitur. I was trying to say two things at once and created a fallacy.üßê
1348667274958290957 2021-01-11 16:25:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Had a few good chats about this last tweet specifically and I appreciate the thoughtful feedback. I acknowledge that a happy and optimistic majority is not by definition mutually exclusive with fascist policy.   Muting the thread now and going to sleep.

I hear you about policy taking time, but I still don't see sufficient evidence today of the efficient, well-functioning representative democracy that my high school Civics class instructor told me we enjoyed.
1348662526041493515 2021-01-11 16:06:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @timeswang This assumes the will of the people in a democracy is actually borne out through the actions of their elected representatives, for which the US has a pretty poor track record.

1348656593680797703 2021-01-11 15:42:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo There are other conditions for fascism beyond militarism, nationalism, and enforcement of ideological unity. I don't think China satisfies any of the economic ones...  From a rhetoric perspective, "fascism" is a fraught word and I use it with much caution.
1348655344788992001 2021-01-11 15:37:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo Modern convention has been to refer to China as authoritarian and I think that's a better word. I think it's fair to say Chinese authoritarianism for some segments of the population is waxing. I believe the goal is basically "Singapore." I wish the goal was more like "Sweden".
1348649487607058437 2021-01-11 15:14:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo I'm happy to criticize both. And I do. But I'm not going to characterize my criticism of China as criticism of a fascist state. I don't use such language for the USA either, no matter how many countries we bomb, coup, or invade (but that's a different tangent).
1348648883123937280 2021-01-11 15:12:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo One country mistreats its minorities as a matter of cultural norms.  The other because the gov't is trying to social engineer some utopian harmonious society and trashing people's lives along the way.  So yes, different, but I don't think anyone has the moral high ground.
1348644688740319233 2021-01-11 14:55:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo This list of groups has a lot of variation and I think it's inaccurate to treat them as examples of the same problem.  Muslims in XJ vs. Muslims outside of XJ very different Christians have only the mildest of issues... Tibet is very complicated FLG is...well FLG is its own thing
1348640299094999044 2021-01-11 14:37:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo Yes the 'American system' is directly responsible for both what I enjoy as a white person AND the mistreatment of POC/vulnerable groups still today. Just as BJ's governance is responsible for both good things enjoyed by the many and the oppression suffered by the few.
1348635331965325315 2021-01-11 14:18:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo China has some pretty significant problems in how it deals with its ethnic minority populations, VERY worthy of critique. I feel hypocritical being aggressive with such critiques though, because I'm an ethnic majority from a country with a pretty terrible track record itself.
1348632497714696192 2021-01-11 14:06:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo Policies in a specific region or against a certain population can be repressive or fascistic (and I agree that XJ is very problematic) without meaning it's accurate or honest to describe the entire government as fascist. We definitely don't hold other countries to that standard.

1348478775223148547 2021-01-11 03:56:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> If you believe China is fascist and sadly mired in a bad state, then you must account for how happy and optimistic the population is, with something more sophisticated than "they are brainwashed".  Otherwise you're ignoring reality that conflicts with your bias. That's denial.
1348478772610093058 2021-01-11 03:56:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The great majority of Chinese people have already experienced huge positive change in their lifetime and also believe things will be *even better* for the next gen. Regardless of how you view their lives, THEY FEEL THEY ARE THRIVING. This should always be reflected in your views.

1348112502152810497 2021-01-10 03:40:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattysino I would expect Chinese "America Watchers" to struggle with America Watching in the same way that "China Watchers" struggle with accurate China Watching.

It's at least a coherent statement tho.  They screwed themselves by writing it so poorly that no one can even get past "baby-making machines".

USA exceptionalism is USA identity. The mere existence of an alterative, no matter how mildly stated, *feels* aggressive to Americans.
1347015338672603136 2021-01-07 03:00:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Note that BJ's  rhetoric for years has been "we have different systems that work for our peoples and the USA must accept this".  But getting an American to accept that a system exists in the world that is a viable alternative to the USA is an attack on American identity itself.
1347014249529241601 2021-01-07 02:56:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome USA is inherently worthy of emulation unless you are evil or stupid --&gt; Chinese people would want to be like the USA if only they could see it clearly --&gt; So Beijing cares a lot about blocking the Chinese people from seeing the USA clearly--&gt; etc.  Daisy chain of bad conclusions
1347012510075867136 2021-01-07 02:49:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome These are not unintelligent people. But they hold to flawed premises that create a flawed foundation. That makes the entire structure faulty in the end. They come up with logical conclusions based on incorrect premises.
1347012079132151809 2021-01-07 02:48:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome They can't come up with novel takes. 95% of their worldview is comprised of calcified (usu. incorrect) premises. Leaves 5% space for novelty. In this case, the key premise that blocks novel thought is:   - Chinese people would want to be like the USA if only they had the chance
1347009582573318145 2021-01-07 02:38:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome They sure manage to get an awful lot wrong about the one thing they're supposed to cover with expertise, don't they?

1346367256486264841 2021-01-05 08:05:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nite_wolfus Oh should clarify I don't agree Cantonese is overrated. I think it's great. I agree it's tough to find good "northern food" in HK, which for them means everything north of Guangdong/Fujian.  IMO usually best place to find regional cuisine (besides the province itself obv.) is BJ.
1346335103551619077 2021-01-05 05:57:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread @CNBC Think the timing is due to CECI and Bohai Rim both suspending their publishing of coal prices over the last few days.

1346173964209438721 2021-01-04 19:17:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @QvistStaffan @CoalFreeDave Thanks for the answer! Hope we can see this tech in application in China someday, although I think both seismic issues and population density siting issues would a bit trickier here, as I mentioned in my QT.
1346173104007987200 2021-01-04 19:14:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> *So we only have coastal plants. Dammit Twitter let me edit.
1346172752458260480 2021-01-04 19:12:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> P.S. It's not like building nuclear reactors in seismically active areas is impossible. It just requires complex and specialized calculations for probabilistic risk assessment and seismic modeling. Chinese firms have done it in Pakistan for their exports but not yet at home.
1346172750960857089 2021-01-04 19:12:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In China specifically, the approval process for inland nuclear plants has halted, partly over seismic safety concerns. So we only coastal plants. If this continues, then only those could be considered for a coal--&gt;nuclear heat  switcheroo someday. Still very interesting. 4/4
1346172749199261696 2021-01-04 19:12:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But siting a nuclear power plant is much more difficult than siting a coal plant. Ecological impact, seismic risks, population centers...the mathematics are different. OP's case study examines PL, which is seismically stable. Unlike inland China... 3/4   https://t.co/t9r0JYJ804
1346172747483729921 2021-01-04 19:12:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For nuclear plants, only 4G tech would work, because they operate at much higher temperatures than our current 3G light water reactors.  China has several 4G reactor types under construction and several more under development. The HTGR is very close. 2/4   https://t.co/bHtNoG7du0
1346172745357250561 2021-01-04 19:12:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is pretty cool. We generate power by spinning turbines with steam. Doesn't necessarily matter where the heat comes from...  Retrofitting relatively 'young' turbine halls for a new heat source (e.g. nuclear) could be a clever way to recoup a portion of recent coal CAPEX. 1/4
1346162366430367744 2021-01-04 18:31:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CoalFreeDave I wonder how many existing coal plant sites could pass the environmental safety and geological/seismic margin assessments suitable to drop a reactor in there instead?   It's hard enough to site nuclear plants when building greenfield, never mind as a stand-in for existing coal..
1346153821731315714 2021-01-04 17:57:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @bencsin That's a fair point. I've played around with my friends to show it off and it didn't pop open, but also none of them are even passingly similar to me.
1346076473879191553 2021-01-04 12:50:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bencsin I got the facial ID on my Xiaomi 9 set up with clean face. But it recognizes me with surgical masks, glasses, even moisturizing face mask. I was able to beat it with Venetian mask for a masquerade party on NYE, and it still somehow ID'ed me once from the ridges around my eyes...
1346058705981194244 2021-01-04 11:39:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @steelmuslim But ok I just grabbed an example close to me that I have more personal experience with. There's a spectrum of mutual intelligibility that goes from "just some tonal shifts" to "can't understand a damn thing". My point is focused on the latter group.
1346057816931405827 2021-01-04 11:36:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @steelmuslim And of course a native speaker might have heard something different...  I also noticed her older relatives were speaking "purer" Hubei hua (I guess) in that I couldn't understand a damn thing they were saying. While I could sometimes catch chunks of what she was saying...
1346057523883696128 2021-01-04 11:34:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @steelmuslim It was on and off for me. There would be whole sentences where I could basically guess what was happening cause it was just the same words with tonal shifts and then whole other sentences where it was totally unintelligible.
1345983304957214720 2021-01-04 06:40:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JJYY1994 @steelmuslim I doubt that Yi language speakers are included in the total of "Native Chinese speakers". At least I hope not, with a different language and unique script.  But I'm sure Shanghainese speakers (surely you meant Suzhounese üòàÔºâ are included in the count...
1345980892687208448 2021-01-04 06:30:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim MY gf is from Hubei. Hubei hua doesn't have a script afaik, and it's mutually unintelligible with Mandarin. She spoke Hubei hua almost exclusively until primary school.  So when my girlfriend learned to write characters in kindergarten, which language's script was she learning?
1345979690540929025 2021-01-04 06:25:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim And aside from Canto, with its handful of Canto-unique characters, I'm not aware if other Chn languages have a unique script (?)   Pre-modern China, literacy rate was like single digits(?) But the people who were literate were indeed writing with the same character sets...
1345978680619667457 2021-01-04 06:21:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim They're speaking past each other now.   Many Sinitic languages spoken in China are mutually unintelligible. Before promulgation of standard Mandarin and widespread literacy growth, I imagine most places in China would have had a lot of trouble communicating w/ elsewhere.
1345945788745019395 2021-01-04 04:10:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Fight4UrRights_ I can almost see your gears whirring in real time, trying to characterize me as a person with opinions you can disregard and ignore because I'm immoral and evil. I get it. It's tough to accept your own inadequacies. Moral judgments are easier.  Anyway muting now.
1345944764479201281 2021-01-04 04:06:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Fight4UrRights_ "I don't want to consider that his opinion which is different from mine is far more credible and informed, so let's go ad hom instead, and call them SEXIST and RACIST and anyone who disagrees is a BAD PERSON".   That's dishonest and infantile. Do better.
1345944254531551232 2021-01-04 04:04:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Fight4UrRights_ This is why people keeping posting the copium meme for you btw.   It's because you've reduced your discussion w/ other people to moral judgments. Like "I don't have to engage with other opinions that would show me to be wrong, because they are BAD PEOPLE".   That's cope.
1345943760035667968 2021-01-04 04:02:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Fight4UrRights_ I believe that you believe that you are a better person than I am. I have no doubt you are earnest in that assertion that I'm a bad person  But honestly that's pretty sick. Your worldview is all fucked. Go see a priest or something.
1345942927835496454 2021-01-04 03:59:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Fight4UrRights_ You know nothing about me, except what you can see from my bio and timeline, both of which would indicate that I am far more likely to be credible on China topics than you are.   So kindly fuck off.

1345938949546471424 2021-01-04 03:43:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @rpotter_9 @steelmuslim The correct way to engage was:  "Hi Temur, although its clear you aren't condoning this video, sharing it at all will put you on the wrong side of regulations about defamatory info and you should remove it".  Otherwise you're just being a jerk because you don't like his politics.
1345935378247684097 2021-01-04 03:29:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DrewPavlou @steelmuslim Perhaps you're used to making things up and having people take it at face value, but in this case the receipts are pretty clear that Temur was in no way supportive of the video.  You are lying and this is harassment, pure and simple.  I've reported you for target harassment.

1343766935431876609 2020-12-29 03:52:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 15 Mainstream analyst opinion (including me!) is that a combination of increased grid connectivity and *definitely* more liberal power sales (i.e. wholesale power markets) is the correct antidote.  Power markets are the future in China, but this is a thread for another day. üòÖ
1343766933842186240 2020-12-29 03:52:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14 The article concludes by quoting several academics with the other more likely solution: that power sector reform needs to continue in the direction of marketization, with real-time supply and demand power pricing allowing more efficient use of energy.
1343766932088999936 2020-12-29 03:52:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13 Finally, the article discusses solutions. UHV is discussed and Hunan's just-approved UHVAC line from Changsha to Nanchang is mentioned. But this can only help with  short-run demand. For long-term, a new UHVDC line is needed, or the existing line needs to up its use rate.
1343766930499366914 2020-12-29 03:52:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12 (So while it's true that coal supply is not directly responsible for China's power rationing in supply, it's certainly true that the inefficient coal pricing mechanism has disincentivized the addition of local coal capacity that would ease power supply tightness in Hunan).
1343766928951705600 2020-12-29 03:52:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11 The article goes on to point out the disconnect between coal fuel pricing and on-grid coal tariffs is a big part of why Hunan is reluctant to add more coal generation.  (China's coal pricing mechanism is a fascinating/nerdy topic that I will do a separate thread on someday).
1343766927135543297 2020-12-29 03:52:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10 Higher coal prices lead to shorter inventories at coal generators. Coal generators hate to buy expensive fuel, because the rate paid by the grid company for their power doesn't change and they have to eat the loss.   https://t.co/D84qvgo2Sq
1343766925558497280 2020-12-29 03:52:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9 The article goes on to discuss the effect of coal supply. Domestic coal supplies are down following mining accidents, a 7-month decline in imports (so not just Aus) and the near deadline for the overall 2020 years-end emissions reduction goals. This has spiked coal prices.
1343766924023406595 2020-12-29 03:52:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8 Originally the Yiwu power savings edict broadly targeted companies, residential communities, and public facilities, while sparing large industrial users. The provincial government refocused to the latter. Yiwu municipal measures were characterized as "an overreaction".
1343766922408562691 2020-12-29 03:52:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7 Zhejiang, on the other hand, is rationing power to try to meet pollution control targets by the end of the year. Yiwu issued aggressive orders to limit power consumption and meet annual goals. (Silly, considering they were propping up consumption earlier this yr).
1343766920860844034 2020-12-29 03:52:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6 Hunan's power shortages are projected to get even worse as the weather gets colder. Hunan belongs to the Central Grid, which get 30% of its power from hydro. Hydro generation has been weak this year due to water shortages.
1343766919254446080 2020-12-29 03:52:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5 SG Hunan says Hunan peak load up to 33 million kw, up 10.4% YoY, exceeding local gen capacity by 4 million kw.  (Thus in peak hours, Hunan is a net importer of power. There is one 8 GW UHV line importing power from Gansu to Xiangtan. It has lifetime utilization rate of ~50%).
1343766917668954112 2020-12-29 03:52:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4 The article also cites SG Hunan saying provincial power demand from Dec 15-17 was 30% higher than this period last year in Hunan, due to cold weather.  (Accuweather historical data confirms this: daily averages nearly 15 degrees C lower this year in Changsha thru December)
1343766916066775041 2020-12-29 03:52:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3 Article first cites overall high consumption as part of post-covid industrial stimulus plan. November 2020 power consumption was up 9.4% YoY and 2.5% YoY overall.   (Does not mention their own reporting from earlier this year about artificial electricity consumption in ZJ).
1343766913252409345 2020-12-29 03:52:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2 Power rationing was implemented in several provinces in China from mid-December. Affected provinces included Hunan (esp. Changsha) and Zhejiang (esp. Yiwu). (Jiangxi is not mentioned but should be true there too according to other reports, with conditions similar to Hunan).
1343766911419469824 2020-12-29 03:52:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Nice article in Caixin Global today about Chinese power rationing. It's paywalled, so I will summarize the key points for the curious with notes in parentheses. (1/15 thread).    https://t.co/lin9SceSOS

Only makes sense for large countries with a big geographic split between generation centers and load centers. In Brazil's case, I assume it's carrying hydro.

1341773602006343680 2020-12-23 15:52:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @saultthomas Yes. Some provinces are requiring minimum 15% -20% of capacity for new RE be covered by accompanying storage. But they get the same tariff as if they had no storage. It's not popular with the developers, obviously. Some see it as an artificial cost barrier to the benefit of coal.
1341760858209153026 2020-12-23 15:01:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JMoVS Because China treats infrastructure as a public good like parks or a police force. Its purpose is to serve the needs of the country, not necessarily turn a profit. State Grid is a state-owned company with huge resources.

1341755486278832129 2020-12-23 14:40:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DuijtsImme Marginal cost here refers to the price to generate the next kilowatt of electricity. Unlike plants that have fuel costs, a solar or wind plant at any given moment generates its next kilowatt for "free".  So once it's built, you should use it.

I'm about to publish a 15-page white paper on the subject and even that barely scratches the surface.   If there are questions, I can try to answer some, insofar as I know the answers. ü•∏
1341289980191068161 2020-12-22 07:50:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 14/14 This massive public infrastructure UHV project makes very little sense in pure economic terms - like highspeed rail. Some lines will likely NEVER pay for themselves. They aren't supposed to. They are public goods, preparing for China's carbon-neutral future.
1341289977477394432 2020-12-22 07:50:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13/14 (If you're interesting in learning more about C&amp;I green power procurement and tracking China's progress toward creating more green power procurement options, I highly recommend following the work of the Rocky Mountain Institute @RockyMtnInst)
1341289974663016449 2020-12-22 07:50:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/14 Of course, that's not to say that UHV lines carry RE exclusively. In fact, most of them carry coal power too. But the options that are opened up for green power procurement by transporting RE from other parts of the country are really exciting.
1341289971903156224 2020-12-22 07:50:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/14 UHV is a critical aid for many other objectives in China's power sector reform:  1. Allowing trading of renewables in wholesale power markets 2. Setting more strict renewable uptake targets for provinces 3. Creating options for I&amp;C customers to procure green power
1341289967734063104 2020-12-22 07:50:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/14  But progress on the Central China Ring Network is forging ahead, even with local gov't and coal stakeholder opposition. Just yesterday, another link of the Ring Network was approved to start construction. Late, but better than never.   https://t.co/FpXEkuFMWR
1341289964978413568 2020-12-22 07:50:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/14 #1 above is especially a problem. Usually provinces want to prioritize local generated power rather than power 'imported' from other provinces. The UHV line power is supposed to get priority dispatch, but local interests are powerful and local coal may be dispatched instead.
1341289962247876608 2020-12-22 07:50:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/14 So far, China's UHV lines have generally had low utilization rates vs. nameplate capacity. The reasons for this vary, but are usually one of:  1. No one wants/needs the power 2. The local grid can't handle the UHVDC volume and needs to build more UHVAC 3. Low generation
1341289959387353090 2020-12-22 07:50:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/14 The reason it's controversial is:  1. Overconnectivity could mean susceptibility to cascading grid failure if a substation or a power plant trips  2. The regulator thinks the economics for these lines is not good enough and won't approve SG's application to build them.
1341289956388454400 2020-12-22 07:50:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/14 In the image from the last tweet, you can see a red-circled area called the "Central China Ring Network". This is planned grid of UHVAC lines that would link up different major cities in Central China and also connect the North, Central, and East Grids.   It's controversial.
1341289953083342849 2020-12-22 07:50:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/14 UHV lines provide a inter-region backbone to transport power hundreds or thousands of km across the country. The UHVDC lines are used for the longest distances, while UHVAC lines are used for shorter distances, often within the same regional grid.   China's UHVAC lines now:  https://t.co/PPb8RMSsSp
1341289944724066306 2020-12-22 07:50:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/14  In the past, poor regional interconnectivity has been a big contributor to low offtake levels of renewable energy. Of course a glut of coal power also played a role. Curtailment has improved in recent yrs tho. I discussed regional grids before:    https://t.co/FnxsXE4iV1
1341289941960019973 2020-12-22 07:50:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/14 So why is China different? Geography plays a huge role. China's load centers are in the coastal East and South, while the best wind, solar, and hydro resources are in the North, Northwest, and Southwest. Power (esp. RE) is being generated far from where it's needed most.
1341289939070173184 2020-12-22 07:50:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/14 In the rest of the world, UHV lines have generally been used sparingly. Submarine power cables (e.g. connecting UK to mainland Europe) and some huge hydropower projects in Quebec are some notable exceptions.  China is building UHV lines on a scale never seen before.

1341087402094292993 2020-12-21 18:25:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danielmarans In terms of an attempt at social engineering and shaping cultural and religious identity, that feels like a closer comparison. Both 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' imply that the intended effect is to wipe the group out of existence, which doesn't match with the evidence.

But Zenz specifically also has some pretty severe (imo) credibility problems wrt his far-right religious background and degree of regional expertise (which is, to put it charitably, very limited).
1341085357757005824 2020-12-21 18:17:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danielmarans I believe among scholars who focus specifically on the (serious) issues in Xinjiang, the ones that choose to characterize it as genocide are...few. *Perhaps* because the Han majority have had similar birth suppression measures for decades under OCP.
1341082082894737408 2020-12-21 18:04:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What sources could a HuffPost reporter be consulting that would lead him to say this?

1340177007171145728 2020-12-19 06:07:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Tom_Fowdy Then a particularly tone-deaf and poor argument for him to make, considering the seeming anti-Semitic content of his other writings.  If I responded to him, I would craft my criticism of his comparison on those grounds, and not by calling the post itself anti-Semitic.
1340176062257360896 2020-12-19 06:04:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 @ConcernedHk I am much less enthusiastic on Xinjiang, based on personal and private accounts of friends in SZ who are XJ minorities and would have no reason to exaggerate or overstate their experiences to me. I don't believe in a genocide. But I am skeptical of many aspects of XJ policy.
1340173953243860997 2020-12-19 05:55:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 @ConcernedHk This is a fair way to understand the moral motivations that affect many China critics, none more overtly than the Christian right.   Personal judgments of morality also motivate secular liberals in the West but it's trickier to drill down to that root with them.
1340170413603577856 2020-12-19 05:41:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk @Jerry_grey2002 I'm going on a tangent with these mock debates in my head, but what I'm trying to show is that we don't even have good discussions about the core of the problem because the rhetoric employed is so facile.
1340169954436423680 2020-12-19 05:39:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk @Jerry_grey2002 And then the rerpartee could be something about how he doesn't hold the authority to pass judgment on the morality of the choices of people in other countries.   Which of course is the crux of his position. He believes he does have this authority.
1340169392886173698 2020-12-19 05:37:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk @Jerry_grey2002 "Is the population's support for a policy necessarily a good measure of how moral it is? The public can be convinced to support many things out of nationalism (or ignorance). Nazism after all was fairly popular in Germany in WW2"   More intelligent way to frame his argument IMO.
1340168073064587264 2020-12-19 05:32:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk @Jerry_grey2002 Right. Could have had a field day with how bad the premise of the argument was. I see as a distraction to go with the antisemitism angle.
1340167445114318850 2020-12-19 05:29:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 I think that's just called evangelical Christianity unfortunately
1340167258664968192 2020-12-19 05:29:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk @Jerry_grey2002 Actually the gross part of his comment as I read it was that he was equating Chinese support for public security with the German public's support for persecution of Jews.  That's just an obscenely stupid comparison.    https://t.co/YD2OhIeQTa
1340165043141234689 2020-12-19 05:20:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 I knew I would take some pushback for making a post which appears to defend Zenz, but really just don't want to sink to their level. There's plenty of solid ways to criticize him without using dishonest attacks. Hurts pro-China camp's credibility.
1340163361372209152 2020-12-19 05:13:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 Regardless of what it says in his book, which I have not read, I don't see it in this post. He might be the world's biggest Nazi for all I know, but that's not supported by the text in this screencap.
1340145260614184960 2020-12-19 04:01:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi Seems a direct response to Swaine's comment about how   "many Chinese like surveillance".  "yeah and many Germans in WW2 supported the persecution of Jews".   It's a shitty argument but it's obviously a rhetorical device and not an expression of antisemitism. Come the fuck on.
1340139182916681730 2020-12-19 03:37:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HohoChan657 He's a creep but this is a dishonest reading of his post. He is speaking from the perspective of the German population in the 1940s. I see nothing in his post that reflects personally on him as an antisemite.
1340129247793270784 2020-12-19 02:58:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi It's infuriating really, after hearing the most disgusting, bigoted things come out of the mouths of (especially) young HKers, and then see them lionized as noble, put-upon underdog heroes. It's gaslighting of the highest order.
1340127072941867009 2020-12-19 02:49:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi Can confirm for me as well. Maybe we've all met different Chinese people. Or maybe that was pulled directly out of his ass because he's confident that no one among his audience would fact check him...
1340122992576086016 2020-12-19 02:33:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YungTseTech @BadChinaTake I bet this generation of kids is going to grow up with much lower rates of lactose intolerance with all the milk and nasty cheese tea things they're drinking.
1340122456284020736 2020-12-19 02:31:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @YungTseTech @BadChinaTake Cheese is uncommon outside of 1st and 2nd tiers, yes, except for cheese capped teas which are everywhere now (ew).  But milk and is available everywhere (and yogurt). Milk is marketed for kids though, (since as someone else pointed out, many adults are lactose intolerant).
1340121399952732160 2020-12-19 02:26:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DarkWorld25 @BadChinaTake Around 80-85% actually but yes, it's still quite a lot.

1340010095304839168 2020-12-18 19:04:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango @Hzzzzzzz3 Also there was one amusingly snarky comment from a Chinese netizen:   "so, was their destroyed house restored to its original state?"
1340009447196790784 2020-12-18 19:02:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @willehelmwonka I used to think the role of a bridge had merit, but seems the people to whom I expected to bridge don't wanna listen.

1339930505613987840 2020-12-18 13:48:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi @SonnySided ÈòøÊòü has all the food knowledge and background, and especially the Chinese food knowledge, but he doesn't quite have the personality and definitely not the jokes like Sonny does. Still learn a lot from his channel though.
1339929816250904578 2020-12-18 13:45:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi @SonnySided The fact that Food Ranger is as popular as it is makes me think that I could do a China food YT channel. Every time I watch his videos I end up yelling at the computer. And my gf is  like "if you're so sure you could do better, then do it". And then I don't. üë∫so....
1339928882296721412 2020-12-18 13:41:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi @SonnySided I watch him as well. I used to watch Mark but his videos all run together for me and his yummy face just annoys me now. I can't stand Trevor James tbh. His " tai haooo luhhh"s and his total lack of regional knowledge or background drive me crazy.
1339921095168643077 2020-12-18 13:10:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi @SonnySided Although in my heart of hearts I know it will and should be a LOCAL food blogger/writer. But still.
1339920794462273536 2020-12-18 13:09:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi I'm a fan of BEFRS @SonnySided and would probably give away my firstborn to be the local "food expert" guide when/if he comes to China again.  I even own merch.
1339915695824388101 2020-12-18 12:49:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi If it hasn't been obvious by my other random tweets here and there, I am a massive foodie and consume a metric ton of food-related media (especially YT). And I just can't watch his shit anymore. Not even the FLG connection...it's just boring content for ABCs and white Americans.
1339912601304592385 2020-12-18 12:37:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @yeolmussi There's also a reason that he goes to Chinatown in literally every single country in the world but never comes to China.
1339897513759817729 2020-12-18 11:37:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @keanfei47 @LaithMarouf There are few pairs of countries in the world that can boast such a congenial relationship such as China and Pakistan have. This seems like a big positive for Pakistan.

It's easy to laugh at them and yeah maybe it finds you some common ground with the China bashers but there are also much more meaningful things to critique.

1339850848449429504 2020-12-18 08:31:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> With China's potential power shortages in the news, I thought I'd RT this old thread for the curious.  The regional grids in tightest supply are East and South. North sometimes, mostly because Shandong is a huge energy pig. Central only when hydrological conditions are poor.

Residential consumers unlikely to be asked to conserve - more likely will be SOEs and gov't buildings if it comes to that.

1339815329812246528 2020-12-18 06:10:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi Reflecting more on this, you know some Western MSM also deign to provide some context and background in their articles...just bury it in paragraph 4, under a salacious headline and 3 paragraphs of biased crap.

Assigning good and evil is a key pillar of the Judeo-Christian world framing. It affects many to a degree they aren't even aware of, even if they aren't religious themselves.
1339793573022105600 2020-12-18 04:44:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg And if you're sharing legitimate grievances, they don't even need to fabricate things anymore.

1339785067183263745 2020-12-18 04:10:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Say you actually want to prepare nuanced, thoughtful, informed critiques of Chinese policy or governance.

It appears to me that he coordinated it with the other neican writer, who RTed it with "read it until the end".

1338430290830610432 2020-12-14 10:27:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @derznovich Yeah cross-provincial dispatch according to published guidelines and according to reality are still two different things. The one completed line is still in limited operations so hard to say.  Hoping for for much higher RPS targets in the 14th FYP which will help with dispatch.
1338429190387818496 2020-12-14 10:22:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @derznovich Yes and of course realizing much lower than than, although as I understand that has as much to do with the underdeveloped AC network on the receiving end as it does with anything else.
1338428255188131842 2020-12-14 10:18:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @derznovich Yeah that's true for all of the older ones (else the RE component was all hydro). Newer batch including ones I mentioned are supposedly 100% wind/solar. Have to assume storage fairly important for those.  We'll publish a China UHV whitepaper next week - welcome your critique üòÖ
1338424238382829568 2020-12-14 10:02:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @derznovich Surely inter-region UHV lines are giving legacy thermal generators heartburn then.  Of course just Qinghai-Henan for now (as Zhangbei-Xiong'an is different and special) but there's a bunch more UHV lines coming that are purpose built for RE bases, including cross-province/region
1338420264959283201 2020-12-14 09:47:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta Is it too cynical to think of this primarily as a win for the coal lobby (and not due to the efforts of the storage industry?) I've spoken to people at CNESA who led me to think that the storage lobby played a role here too.

So while it may be dystopian and icky overall, it also appears to be equal, at least nominally.

You can also get them to lug small things around, like when I brought my BBQ grill to a pool party. You make the reservation online like you're booking a cab and a guy with a van shows up at your place an hour later...super convenient. üòÅ

Chinese is shorter and the syntax is denser. Characters take up less space than the corresponding word or phrase in English.   Example:  "Socialism with Chinese characteristics"   "‰∏≠ÂõΩÁâπËâ≤Á§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâ"

If you don't speak Chinese, nor have you ever lived here, then you aren't qualified to understand how and why you aren't qualified.  I don't know how this is controversial in 2020.

Especially with that 5 RMB discount for bringing your own cup...that can't be sustainable.
1336359532872622081 2020-12-08 17:18:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno Hmmmm yes. According to my expert opinion, it sounds like you have a very severe case of being Italian.
1336358923780018176 2020-12-08 17:16:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Yang_Supertramp The original Manner Coffee "window in the wall" on Nanyang Road was across the street from my apartment.  And now I live upstairs from a Manner Coffee here in SZ...   I'm so proud of them üòÄ
1336356602257887233 2020-12-08 17:06:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Yang_Supertramp I lived just down the street from it when it opened. There was a 50-100 person line to get in there all day long. Craziness...  I've paid 68 for a pour-over coffee with fancy single-origin  beans, but I wouldn't pay that much for any coffee-flavored dairy beverage.
1336355795068317696 2020-12-08 17:03:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno Wow, more than 4 cups? I bet you're a terrible person in the morning before you've had coffee then.  Well I mostly tweet about China, its language, and its food. So you're in the right place I guess. Oh and now apparently I tweet about coffee too.
1336353352242798592 2020-12-08 16:54:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno And thanks for the follow. You seem quick picky about whom you chose to follow, so considered me honored. I'll make a point to tweet about my (many cups of) coffee tomorrow, just for you üòÜ

1336322506395852800 2020-12-08 14:51:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @wamika_kapur Korea coffee culture is absurd haha. And you started exporting them to China over the last 5 years as it took off here. Twosome Place, Caffe Bene, Zoo Coffee, Pascucci, Holly's, etc... all have locations in China now.
1336321547817033730 2020-12-08 14:47:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno @michshsh On the question of procedure...I rarely order Americano so I don't often observe. Mine arrived with no crema, so I guess they poured the water over the espresso (i.e. the wrong order). I wouldn't expect a dedicated coffee shop to do this, but this place is more bar than caf√©.üôÉ

It would have been rare to find pour-over coffee just 5 years ago, but now it's easy to find shops with beans from Honduras, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Sumatra...etc. and many of them roast in-house too.
1336314014574419968 2020-12-08 14:17:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno @michshsh Most coffee shops have very high end equipment...many imported Italian espresso machines.  Materials...ahh it's maybe about half that are actually using nice beans in their expensive equipment. If they have good beans, they usually also have well-trained staff.
1336308580056612865 2020-12-08 13:56:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno @michshsh China does this thing where a single espresso will be 15 or 20 rmb but if you want double espresso it costs only 5 rmb more and a triple espresso is only 5 rmb more after that...

1336186139493842944 2020-12-08 05:49:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @marvinlim707 @JoanPohYY The identical phrase has two meanings which are both valid - it's a kind of Chinese pun. Different verbal emphasis would make it more obvious. In this case ÊàëÂñúÊ¨¢‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∫∫ could mean either "I like a person‚Äù or "I like to be alone". That wordplay is the basis of all of these jokes.

It gets tricky in smaller places, because a lot of guesthouses and hostels don't to do the police registration thing, so there might only be a handful of choices.

People are just glad to be living better lives. Maybe in another generation they'll start demanding more from their government, but for now full bellies, new houses, enough cash to send your kids to school...is more than enough for most.

Vast majority say yes.  Ask CHN people if their children's generation will live better than they do? Vast majority say yes.   Now ask who they think should get the credit for that? Hmm, turns out it's the gov't...

Not that you didn't study it for a long time or anything, just that you can't actually learn Chinese and get really competent and still be this ignorant...

You said it maybe because you thought it's impossible to verify/deny, but it's too easy to laugh away as a lie. Like Trump.

It's like a Trump lie, too bizarre to take seriously. You can't get away with claiming these things to CHN people or long-time (actually fluent) expats. You're over your head and you don't want this debate, trust me.

NGO, think tank, academia, State Dept...  And then in China you've got marketing/creative, supply chain...   Specialty consulting applies to both but is very limited and you're competing with native speakers.

For most jobs in China, probably just makes more sense to hire a local 95 times outta 100.

It's kind of like mixing expensive whiskey with green tea, to add milk to fancy beans. ;)  Nothing wrong with latte/flat white, just more reasonable to make it with mass-market beans

Dunno how that compares to NA?  SB lattes are 30-36 and not good. I get my latte at a local shop for 15. :)

I prefer the taste of brown sugar over white sugar, but light brown sugar is hard to find and dark is easy.  Brown filling it is.

Looking up Ë±´Ëèú places nearby and they all have this ÁÉ©Èù¢ with broad noodles and a very dense, almost milky looking broth, like bone broth ramen. Is that what you remember?

Last time I went back through there someone was like "oh this really great Shaanxi restaurant in Queens" and I was like wtf seriously that's awesome.

1331264367342411778 2020-11-24 15:52:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango Like the parents didn't feel any needs to assert or prove their Chinese-ness and just tried the food for the flavor, security in their identity that no one would call them "fake Chinese" for liking it?
1331263980443115521 2020-11-24 15:50:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango Yeah definitely appreciate the different dynamics.  Also reminds me of Buzzfeed video of "Chinese People in USA Try Panda Express" and all the 2nd Gen kids were like "tHiS iS nOt ReAl cHiNeSe foOD" while the 1st Gen parents were like "hmmm this is not bad, I think it's tasty".
1331262310086713355 2020-11-24 15:44:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango Yeah I saw it as an interesting linguistic point more than anything. There were also comments from Indians pointing that that "pav roti" in Hindi/Urdu is also literally "bread bread" (pav coming from Portuguese pao). It happens.
1331261428364263424 2020-11-24 15:40:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango Reminded me of that dynamic from when the white girl wore a qipao to prom in the US. People in China were very positive on it while many Chn-Americans were screaming cultural appropriation.  QTs looked like a lot of very angry diaspora...wonder what Indians in Indian would think.

So by that logic "ShAInghai" is English and "ShAHnghai" is Mandarin and both are words. I follow the logic, just not sure how I feel about it.

1330747996833603584 2020-11-23 05:40:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In SZ airport, it often takes longer to walk from security to your gate than it takes to get checked in and go through security.  Today they were an even 15 minutes for both. That's half an hour total from curbside to gate.   How long is your "airport commute?"

If there are specific criticisms of the dates, actions, and inferences, that would be the best way to work out how we have interpreted the same evidence to different conclusions. Otherwise we're just shouting past each other.
1330377992942592000 2020-11-22 05:10:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NeysunM @Dali_Yang @ChuBailiang @joshchin @gerryshih @YanzhongHuang As this (now very notably poorly predictive) article cites: 15 health care workers were infected between 1/12 and 1/21.  That then is the period when human-to-human should/could have been confirmed. So as many as 9 days lost by WH health authorities. Not "weeks"...
1330371833661595650 2020-11-22 04:45:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How can a "China scholar" uncritically and unironically repeat assertions from the WaPo and NYT that there was a "weeks-long" coverup, given the evidence to the contrary?   The general public may be forgiven for being fooled by the mountain of media disinformation, but not you.
1330369292781568000 2020-11-22 04:35:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy @phl43 Because of the partisan media divide in the US, liberals tend to uncritically support WaPo and NYT on domestic issues (where I think they are generally much better) and have a blind spot for how objectivity and quality fall off a cliff for these outlets' international coverage.
1330368606715015168 2020-11-22 04:32:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And unfortunately his replies concluded with this bizarre red herring:   https://t.co/yzThqNezbz
1330365869688582150 2020-11-22 04:21:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Agreed it was a bad take. Majority of evidence still suggests China is origin of outbreak.  Sadly, OP then goes on to repeat disinformation about the early days of the epidemic.  ICYMI, @phl43 analysis is the gold standard on the early days timeline:   https://t.co/UsUwUfPf77

1330352578945806341 2020-11-22 03:29:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NeysunM @peijin_zhang I read the original interview with Feng Zijian in Caixin. He indeed expressed frustration that the early-warning system was not utilized as intended.  Not clear that it would have confirmed human-to-human spread and thus prompt an earlier lockdown.
1330350563343560704 2020-11-22 03:21:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NeysunM @peijin_zhang There's limited evidence to suggest *weeks*. You have your timelines confused perhaps.  WHO was notified almost immediately.  Between "could have and should have been able to ID human-to-human spread" and Zhong Nanshan's announcement was about...5 days maybe.
1330168923992584194 2020-11-21 15:19:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @_Dinger_s @coherentstates @ImNotOwned And because NZ and AUS are so close, they just picked up resistance like a contact high?
1330123278229393410 2020-11-21 12:17:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @R_Mc_Lean I think yes. We'll actually be in BJ talking to them about this next week. I'm working on a grant-funded project right now focused on low-carbon BRI. Infrastructure bank commitments play a big role. Lot of pressure on them from different directions to take this step.
1330121902220861447 2020-11-21 12:12:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck I don't think anyone is disputing that. The article is about AIIB making a commitment to not fund any more coal plants going forward.  Chinese infrastructure bank funding for overseas thermal power projects has been a major (and generally valid) criticism of BRI investment.
1330120014377136128 2020-11-21 12:04:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @freqflyer_ck I assume it will not apply to projects already underway/with funds already committed.

ADB should be very close to making a similar statement.  Will be interesting to see what the Chinese commercial banks will do now. The pressure must be on...

Shandong is also home to the under-construction CAP1400 (indigenous Chinese design expansion of the AP1000) at Rongcheng, Shidaowan as well as the 4G High-Temp Gas Reactor (HTGR)

In this case specifically we both went to the Nanjing campus, where the China nerds go.  You'll see SAIS in the bios of a number of illustrious China opinion-havers ü§°

1329441193927847940 2020-11-19 15:07:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill By contrast, an incognito browser Google search in English turns up the video with no problem at all...it's the 3rd result in Google for "ASPI Daniel Dumbrill".   So this was specifically executed on the YouTube end, dissociating that keyword from your video as a search result.
1329439530462699535 2020-11-19 15:00:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill Some curious results from the YouTube keyword search bar:   "ASPI Daniel Dumbrill" has your videos, but not the ASPI one  ‚ÄúV*cky X* Daniel Dumbrill" has it  "ASPI Circus" turns up your other videos, but NOT the ASPI video. So the algo knows you published it but won't show it.
1329427578684272641 2020-11-19 14:13:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danbudhwan I think it depends on field of specialization. Definitely avoid security studies if you want to avoid those kinds. I felt ERE was ok (energy, resources, and environment)  You are correct that debt and unemployment (or more likely underemployment) are more concerning :(

1329344303110320128 2020-11-19 08:42:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @llggeorgia It's remarkable how much confidence you can have on a topic of which you have so little understanding.  Imagine someone on the phone saying they know the color of the walls in your home better than you do, when you're sitting in your kitchen staring at the wall.  That's you.

1329129252734734336 2020-11-18 18:28:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> So apparently my profile has been checked twice on Bot Sentinel: once after pushing back against the China food shortage story and once after my thread yesterday.  I'm 3% a bot BTW üôÉ

Sure you, as a "Poll Watcher" knew that the Milwaukee absentee ballots were gonna break heavy blue.
1329051197286744064 2020-11-18 13:17:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @conceptedge And of course lots of opinions about traditional characters and deep insight into how Taiwan represents the "real" Chinese culture.
1329050463811977216 2020-11-18 13:14:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @conceptedge What's more dangerous IMO than the ones that have never been to China and don't speak Chinese is the ones that studied abroad for 5 months...in Taiwan.  Then they get to go back and play "East Asia expert" with their HSK3 Mandarin and nonexistent knowledge of the Mainland.
1329031583936888832 2020-11-18 11:59:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @tommygunn12us Newsflash: the country is already a shithole.  If you had ever left it and gone to ANY of those countries, you'd know this.

1328999184280612867 2020-11-18 09:51:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread I bought a corded hammer drill on Taobao back when I was doing some soft reno work on my Airbnb in SH. Sold it when I moved though. It's a great tool to have if you think you'll use it more than once...the walls in SH apartments are almost always concrete except for lane houses.
1328996757468954624 2020-11-18 09:41:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crushspread The type of drill you need is called ÂÜ≤ÂáªÂºèÊâãÈíª if you want to do it yourself with handheld drill. And you'll need a masonry/concrete bit Áì∑Á†ñÁîµÈíªÂ§¥ or Ê∑∑ÂáùÂúüÁîµÈíªÂ§¥„ÄÇ   Or you can find handyman, tell him you already have the expansion plug and screws; you just need holes drilled.
1328939212209524738 2020-11-18 05:52:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AtulBeret I rather like your characterization of it as "knowledge production".  After all, a factory produces goods precisely to the specifications of the buyer, while the think tank produces knowledge precisely to the specifications of its funders.
1328936945322483720 2020-11-18 05:43:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @stillreezy @thelongwallz Wait yes this is a compliment in NA too.

1328914709249019908 2020-11-18 04:15:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango @RealSexyCyborg Perhaps it would be cathartic? I mean hey if you get something from it, sure. Seemed like it would have low ROI for you and just raise your blood pressure, hence my suggestion :)
1328913795750588416 2020-11-18 04:11:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gofango @RealSexyCyborg Considering the size and visibility of Naomi's platform, she has every right to be wary.

Do you get enough sunlight while being indoors more than before? Apparently it's quite important as a mood stabilizer. It affects me in the winter.   https://t.co/Js2dI3QpEj
1328692239296393218 2020-11-17 13:31:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Andybaldridge71 @ZubyMusic Sure seems like a bad plan to attack your enemy by releasing a virus on your own population, squash it, and then cross your fingers that your opponent does the exact wrong thing.  I had a great meal tonight.
1328684825721462795 2020-11-17 13:02:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @WilsonatorYT @AlexLacey19 You seem to talk about this potentiality a lot when things go wrong but I only ever see positivity in your comments and replies. Are you letting the the voices of the negative 0.5% drown out the 99.5% support?  People like your content for you. Shit happens, we all know. It's OK.
1328682925718528001 2020-11-17 12:54:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Andybaldridge71 @ZubyMusic Initially it was believed to be SARS or something very similar. People were freaking out even before lockdowns were announced. Also a huge, elderly, possibly respiratory-compromised population (smog) and high pop. density. Lots to fear.
1328678400043544576 2020-11-17 12:36:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZubyMusic Precisely. Lockdown, quarantine, contract tracing, masks, isolation, zero tolerance. It also helped that these measures were taken when the overall caseload was still relatively low too. Makes tracing and isolation of recent contacts possible.
1328656955259293696 2020-11-17 11:11:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Svetlana305 Easy...don't. Go out and find somewhere with coffee and nice cakes ;)  But more seriously, as I've been doing this for a while...set a timer for 1 hour of work, then 20 minutes of rest, check Twitter, etc...then back to 1 hour of work. Helps keep me sane.
1328638465064333312 2020-11-17 09:57:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome @Silmarillion88 On a few occasions I can look back and say "yeahhh, I deserved that block".  Like if I took a real gratuitous shot, I would do the same in their shoes. But that's v. rare, and I'd have to be really incensed (and potentially have a drink in my hand). Didn't think I did that here.
1328635985567965187 2020-11-17 09:47:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @PAstynome Well seems a number of them are blocking me now, so you won't have to worry about my sanity much longer. It'll be just me and @andymok in our own little echo chamber. /s
1328634190590398465 2020-11-17 09:40:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This tweet response got them especially riled up.

1328629238929317888 2020-11-17 09:21:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And so smug. I mean it's not like they have a monopoly on smugness...of course we are all guilty of it sometimes.  But the unerring winking confidence that they alone have the inside channel on How Things Work in China (from their cubicles in DC) is especially bewildering.
1328627318454030337 2020-11-17 09:13:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The most frustrating thing about the China think tank/academic/journo circuit in the US is how insulated the ideas are.  Feels like the same 20-30 people endlessly citing and amplifying each other in an endless feedback loop, while sharing the same underlying structural biases.

And I assume the grapefruit hybrid was created somewhere in the West? Because of the Chinese name of the grapefruit being literally "Western pomelo"...

One of the measures to address the chronic under-funding of the Renewable Energy Development Fund will be to aggressively pursue surcharge collections from those industrial users.

I'd be supportive of more states being able to do this beyond ME and NE. Imagine being a GOP voter in rural CA or a Dem voter in Jackson, MS...you've been basically disenfranchised for years.

Rural CA voted red. Urban MS voted blue.  So your 45% would actually represent a bloc skewed to rural interests.  Btw not saying 55% of urban votes should dominate the rural voters either.

As I said, the dome that appears in the background of this video appears to still be there now.  I'm not disputing that it was destroyed. I'm disputing that it matters.

It's appears it's no longer a tourist attraction or used for prayer. Hard to conclude anything else about it.

I'm not sure when it was taken but appears to show the dome still there on the left side of the construction. I guess this was the original architecture.  Note also the "Islam Culture Art Gallery" several hundred meters down the road.  https://t.co/aQ0DDaPXKT

The boat part on the right was demolished in Dec 2019 as an illegal construction addition. The dome portion on the left is still visible now in Google Earth.  There are also 80+ other mosques in Lanzhou city.

1325753222716301313 2020-11-09 10:52:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is a completely unsupported take. Tonally, state media has all been cautiously positive on Biden.

Because their requests were denied, they were only allowed to begin on election day.
1324023644146659329 2020-11-04 16:20:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HalfTangible @MCumberbark @lachlan The states that allow counting absentee ballots in advance, yes.  But not MI, WI, and PA.  Because their state law forbids it. Like I said.

1323941144464535553 2020-11-04 10:52:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @Silmarillion88 But overall it seems the industry of poll data collection and analysis is facing a horribly failed referendum on its relevance and capacity for accurate prediction.   Not just the Prez race. House predictions were appallingly bad and wrong.

There's surely a reason that it was ranked as a low-quality poll overall.  Perhaps certain pollsters "get" certain states better than others when it come to sampling.
1323937759677935617 2020-11-04 10:38:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @Silmarillion88 The polls that were closer to accuracy in FL this time around (Trafalgar, Rasmussen) were devalued in pollster aggregators like 538 for their supposed poor quality scores or bias, so they don't affect the headline poll averages much.  But it turns out they were right.

Dogs enjoy a privileged status as pets or working animals (and thus not food) in most parts of the world, including indeed the majority of places in China.  Yulin was an anachronistic exception.

1320983498258198530 2020-10-27 06:59:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill @RealSexyCyborg Yulin earned itself hatred all over China for their dog meat and lychee festival, which I guess is now just a lychee festival, since dogs were declared officially protected as pets  a few months ago.  So it's dishonest, racist, AND outdated to go after that. What an idiot.

1320981814744211457 2020-10-27 06:53:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nise_yoshimi Yeah the Macanese basically embraced their status, readily learned Mandarin, opened their arms to Mainland tourists, and have happily reaped the rewards while maintaining their independent system. They should be a case study...

It's amazing how all specialists in international trade and economics and development funding and Chinese diplomacy reached one conclusion but you were too smart for all of them and reached your different conclusion. You should write a book.

You aren't as clever as you think you are. Perhaps you could talk less and learn more from those who know better.  "Are you on a VPN?" is bottom feeder China Twitter parasite trash.

This person has no idea what's going on in China, and no interest in finding out. They are the kind to believe that Western media reports in a free and unbiased way.

If it weren't for people who actually have relevant experience in and with China, your disinformation would probably be believed more broadly.

Feudal Tibet sucked for everyone who wasn't part of the nobility (i.e. your family).   Stop being a self-interested fascist.  You don't speak for anyone but yourself.

Of course once it's established you're a real person, you can graduate from "bot" to "CCP shill" just like that, so there's still no winning.
1320255452341362689 2020-10-25 06:46:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SimonSW13 @ZichenWanghere Reminds of me the "why should we stop calling it Peking just cause China doesn't want us to? We've always called it Peking. I LIKE calling it Peking" guy.
1320254244205649925 2020-10-25 06:41:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SimonSW13 @ZichenWanghere Yeah whether they keep them or change them is 100% their business, and I think it's fine either way. But foreigners getting their panties in a bunch about it is just stupid colonial arrogance.

1320199010414596096 2020-10-25 03:02:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BadChinaTake I wonder if there's a tie-in to the relative quiet from other Islamic majority countries in the world. Maybe they see (or have been convinced to see) it as an ethnic issue, not a religious issue?
1320198157322522626 2020-10-25 02:59:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Sun42John @DanielDumbrill Yeah I should emphasize OP was being intentionally sarcastic.
1320194130803212290 2020-10-25 02:43:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BadChinaTake Will keep an eye out.  Recommend preciseness in usage of ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù, as Hui people in Xinjiang and elsewhere seem essentially unaffected. A Kazakh minority friend told me (seemingly with a bit of resentment) that the Huis in XJ have no issues.
1320190900249657346 2020-10-25 02:30:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @BadChinaTake Care to share what the forthcoming "chapters" might cover as you work past the first 10%?
1320187859773517824 2020-10-25 02:18:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill This reveals the crux of the matter I think.   "Maybe they wish to be slaves".   Makes it pretty clear whose benefit they represent....   https://t.co/N4ZNEMOiFy

1319643198193451008 2020-10-23 14:13:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MildSpicyGloria Well I've noted that business contacts always use my full time or my work title, while personal friends have no problem calling me by my name only, with no surname (I am referring to Chinese name here).  Of course conventions may work differently for me though...

High school and college friends?

Spending a lot of time reading Western news about China doesn't make you a expert in anything.  I guarantee you that Chinese leadership is far more informed about the state of the world than you are.
1319587353237749760 2020-10-23 10:31:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MichaelSchuman Chinese are not cheering for America's decline...Are you projecting perhaps?  I'm not surprised that you think that, because it's a common misconception, but a mainstream bad take is still a bad take.  You seem to be pretty unqualified to have opinions on China at all. Stop.
1319508840417619968 2020-10-23 05:19:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jane_Li911 This is logical consumer behavior. Chinese phone flagships often out-perform iPhones handily for a fraction of the cost.  Irrational patriotic buying isn't propping up Huawei's sales; Irrational brand loyalty is propping up Apple's.

You're a leech on society and the world.  No one should have to waste their time discussing world matters with what a basically a sentient tumor. I block and move on.

On Day 1 the bad guys are evil scheming masterminds plotting mass genocide, but on Day 2 they're fools who forget Google Earth is a thing and reveal their plans via public docs.  The CCP is as ruthlessly competent or as bumblingly foolish as the plot requires.

Projecting from prolonged Trump exposure?

1316962372570042371 2020-10-16 04:41:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TonkatsuBC @RealSexyCyborg I have it on Facebook because I have Chinese friends on there who know me by the name so I want to be findable. But no such need on Twitter - I don't know anyone here IRL and I don't care to use a few characters to prove to anyone that I have "China qualifications".
1316961666215694337 2020-10-16 04:38:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TonkatsuBC @RealSexyCyborg It's a normal part of learning the language - to take a CHN name and the accompanying characters. I have one that I've been using for a decade and respond to it as easily as my ENG name. I just don't feel the need to prove it by putting it in my Twitter username. :)
1316954568215957504 2020-10-16 04:10:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg @truelai @glevonian This is an astute observation.
1316953841997406208 2020-10-16 04:07:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @truelai @RealSexyCyborg @glevonian This goes back to the ongoing discussion about "being nice".   If you're feeling charitable, sure, go for it. If I'm in a good mood, not busy, and the person is friendly and nice about it, perhaps I'll chat in English a little bit. But I'm under no obligation to do so...
1316950742385758208 2020-10-16 03:54:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Russdaren @RealSexyCyborg I would argue that ESL for native Chn speakers is equally as difficult as CSL for native Eng speakers, but for different reasons.  I do not agree that English is an easy language with few idiosyncrasies - quite the opposite. Preposition usage for example is basically arbitrary.
1316947412703940609 2020-10-16 03:41:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @truelai @RealSexyCyborg @glevonian Teaching English is a commodity with value in China. So there's no real reason for someone with that ability to give it away for free, unless it's in a trade (i.e. language exchange) or out of personal motivation (i.e. friendship, romantic relationship).
1316821827449024512 2020-10-15 19:22:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LunaDiGiugno @transartforall Someone else mentioned French in this thread. My impression there has always been...if you're going to speak French with the French, it had had better be goddamn pristine, or else be prepared for the ego-crushing "can we just speak English?".
1316820353256026112 2020-10-15 19:16:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @_Earthworms_ Well if you speak English in English-speaking countries, it's just kind of taken for granted, right? Like ok, you're here and you're speaking English, cool. Nothing praiseworthy.  And if you don't speak well enough to be understood clearly, you might get side-eyed.
1316807459940364288 2020-10-15 18:25:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MscAmir1 Oh yeah for sure encourage them to keep studying. Just don't contribute to an inflated sense of ego by telling them they're great when they aren't.  I swear some of those overseas "China watchers" were seriously over-praised while they were doing that semester study abroad...
1316803178889801728 2020-10-15 18:08:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Joshua_Fern There's probably some truth to this - when a foreigner opens their mouth and starts speaking Chinese, it is indeed "something to say" to comment positively on their language skills, even if they aren't super impressive. Especially because our predecessors have set the bar low...
1316764747765669888 2020-10-15 15:35:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @malware_shaolin If they speak English or any other Romance language already, I think they should be shamed for not picking up at least a conversational level of Portuguese after 2 years.... :) Sure there will be mistakes but come on.
1316763483883532288 2020-10-15 15:30:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @glevonian @RealSexyCyborg There's like a whole country of people that'll speak Chinese with you (even if their English is better...) and some small fraction that just isn't interested - obviously Naomi included. Not the end of the world...find someone else. No one has a duty to speak ANY language to you.
1316741270992089088 2020-10-15 14:02:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @elkmovie You're just out here making it too easy for us.    https://t.co/SD4LPxjzuU
1316739508050649090 2020-10-15 13:55:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RealSexyCyborg Yeah agreed - just default to the language that will result in the best communication result.  I prefer if everyone can just speak in their native language actually, but many people find that unnatural, e.g. hearing a question in English and replying in Chinese.
1316737239221633026 2020-10-15 13:46:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @elkmovie I used Integrated Chinese and NPCR for my earliest textbooks and thought they both did a pretty good job of avoiding the cutesy pictogram explanations route. Useful supportive info, but agreed should not be the main tool.  Goes without saying but I'll say it anyway: big fan.
1316709800613355520 2020-10-15 11:57:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @FreshEggsDaily @bangordailynews Blatant ballot stuffing. üòâ  By that measure, I think my hometown's population just quadrupled.
1316706139153735680 2020-10-15 11:43:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @bangordailynews I like how this map of the 2nd district highlights how much of the state has no towns or people whatsoever
1316705216297799680 2020-10-15 11:39:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim His years of expertise have been preparing him for this moment.
1316695091000406019 2020-10-15 10:59:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And don't forget everyone, this is inherently threatening and dangerous because China is Bad.  Only US corporations and intelligence agencies should have the capability to collect this information about US citizens, because they are inherently Virtuous and Good.
1316682127094681600 2020-10-15 10:07:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @laurimyllyvirta @FrankTuijnman Such a deep decarbonization scenario where demand is covered by almost entirely by PV/wind + storage plus a some amount of nuclear also has to imagine some amazing advancements vs. today in terms of demand management, smart dispatch and reductions in storage cost/efficiency.
1316673080740081665 2020-10-15 09:31:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @birbnestsoup Encourage native speakers to use the same standard for evaluating the Chinese of their overseas relatives that they use to evaluate non-Chinese foreigners? üòÇ
1316670872913018881 2020-10-15 09:22:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @jonlsullivan @miller_wf YouTube has a few great collections of "China car insurance scam fails" where the attempted skullduggery was captured on dashboard cams.  Some of them are obviously silly looking, but you can tell for others that there would have been some trouble without the camera evidence.
1316624567947804672 2020-10-15 06:18:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SohrabAhmari I'm sure it's just jarring for you realize your career is built on lying, distorting, insinuating, and misrepresenting and it turns out some people actually don't like that.
1316623660493361152 2020-10-15 06:15:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ShanghaiHannah @ZhaoyinFeng Oh I know it was popular - even if only a few curious locals visited it, there's like 400k expats in SH...more than enough to support their business. They did well on Sherpa's.  In SmSh article on their departure, owner said they were lucky to leave "without debt" after 3 years.
1316607725871144960 2020-10-15 05:11:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @transartforall Ahahah sorry.  There's an interesting story to that phrase you just used by the way. Looks like Chinese and Greek are roughly tied around the world in terms of perceived unintelligibility. You must be from one of the countries that references Chinese.   https://t.co/PVMbH7UfSx
1316606085059416066 2020-10-15 05:05:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @transartforall First semester of Chinese I didn't grasp that ÊïôÂÆ§ and ÊïôÂ∏à use jiao4 but Êïô by itself is jiao1.  Literally last year finally realized I'd been saying ÊàëÂè´‰Ω† for 10 years every time I tried to say ÊàëÊïô‰Ω†.  Soul crushing.
1316604201212887040 2020-10-15 04:57:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @transartforall No joke. I'm still now discovering words I've been saying wrongly for nearly a decade now because no one ever corrected me and I've hard coded a mispronunciation. It takes me months sometimes to undo it.
1316596767341731841 2020-10-15 04:28:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This should be periodically retweeted and resurfaced from now until 2100.
1316590779972771841 2020-10-15 04:04:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mztsla @akaDashan Well he was a professional Áõ∏Â£∞ performer and those guys, by the very nature of their job, are supposed to speak better than everyone ;)  But what's most impressive is that he speaks like that in interviews too, not just prepared performances.
1316590008954953728 2020-10-15 04:01:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mztsla @akaDashan Dashan wrecked the curve for a whole generation of Chinese language learners. And he did it without modern electronic dictionaries or anything. So much respect.
1316588807647490049 2020-10-15 03:56:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay Watterson is famously media shy so unlikely he talked about it. But I remember in one of his prefaces, he definitely mentioned Peanuts, &amp; the artistic style of Krazy Kat as influences.  Found a source that says only 5% of Argentine children who read Mafalda like soup. lol
1316585774062600193 2020-10-15 03:44:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 @moghilemear13 Oh if you're just talking reading and writing normally for productivity purposes, then yes I agree. Making the jump from "I can read the textbook" to "I can read this scholarly article and it isn't going to take all day" is a big leap.
1316585218644475909 2020-10-15 03:42:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 @moghilemear13 Well I mean f*ck handwriting things, ÊêúÁãóÊãºÈü≥ËæìÂÖ•Ê≥ï has rendered me functionally useless when it comes to writing anything.
1316584575821180928 2020-10-15 03:39:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Encourage native Chinese to use the same standard for evaluating foreigners' Mandarin that native English speakers hold the rest of the world to for English.  Stop being polite and saying it's good when it's shit. You got foreigners out there believing it.
1316583409657868289 2020-10-15 03:35:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @moghilemear13 You know her Chinese is almost certainly crap.  When you're at the point where Chinese people tell you your Mandarin is pretty good, it's shit.  When they tell you it's AMAZING it's still shit.  When they tell you "you're like a native speaker" you're finally getting kinda ok.
1316580993088643078 2020-10-15 03:25:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RodericDay I went searching and found a few strips that were translated into English that definitely have similar energy...very cool. I wonder if the creator of C&amp;H was familiar with Mafalda - it predated him by a bit but I don't think he ever cited it as an influence.
1316436382655688704 2020-10-14 17:51:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Truth2Upeople I like how they're 'allowed' to wear something besides a black suit lol
1316428068940963842 2020-10-14 17:18:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhaoyinFeng There was Fortune Cookie which carved out a little space for itself in Shanghai for many years as the only American Chinese food in town, but they disappeared a few years ago. I heard it was mostly expats and a trickle of curious locals, who were mostly unimpressed.

Threatening because China's economic bribery is buying diplomatic allies in the UN to oppose the West, but also a poorly-executed failure of a initiative that is creating only "transactional friendships" and arousing suspicion. @MaitreyaBhakal

I was imprecise with my commentary -  it wasn't actually directed at you specifically, more a general statement for those who may find something inherently threatening in the concept of a "Chinese rejuvenation‚Äù.
1316224531686514688 2020-10-14 03:49:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @harbinenthusia1 Perhaps we should re-examine who determines the membership criteria for the "international community"?
1316223302122102785 2020-10-14 03:44:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Interesting meeting with very bullish Chinese green energy investment fund manager in BJ yesterday. Re: carbon neutrality he said (paraphrasing):  "We need to say ZERO CARBON, not LOW CARBON. 5% or 10% reduction is lower. Low carbon means nothing.  And we can do it before 2060".

1316214961132109824 2020-10-14 03:11:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Does vocal support for China's issues of international contention at the UN count, or is that also categorized as "transactional friendship"?

1315303200719728640 2020-10-11 14:48:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill Oh mannn, I remember that story. In the stupid China news timeline, that's basically ancient history.
1315153008624168960 2020-10-11 04:51:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sea_aer @BeltandRoadDesk Even that many blows my mind, knowing the ubiquity of smart phones in even the rural areas of the country, but I don't spend much time in rural areas in the west/north/northwest so I imagine that's where the disconnected people are.

1314871485970878464 2020-10-10 10:12:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan I mean, I guess you would, if pre-1959 Tibetan society was a pretty good, comfortable situation for you and/or your family.  But by most scholarly accounts of the region, including non-Chinese ones, your family would have been in the minority.
1314870616319651840 2020-10-10 10:09:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan Clearly there's been a trade-off...a loss of self-determination post-1959 in exchange for material benefits, especially for lower tiers of society that were not so privileged under the prior system of governance. Are you so sure those living there today would choose to go back?
1314868549760892930 2020-10-10 10:01:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan Not saying that I know for sure the outcome to such a situation either. I haven't been to Tibet to do an anthro-socio survey.  Just that you would probably be surprised, because I can tell your position on the matter is informed by a lot of emotional rhetoric and not much else.
1314867881520238592 2020-10-10 09:58:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan So no answer for my question then, right? Are YOU are the arbiter of truth and the determinant of justice?   You seem very confident that if the people of Tibet indeed had the right to self-determination, that they would choose a different government. You might be surprised...
1314859591088238593 2020-10-10 09:25:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan You didn't take long to jump directly to "you must be a shill for the regime". It's dishonest and a weak position to argue from. Try to avoid it if you can.   You didn't answer my question. Who is the arbiter of truth in this situation? How do you practically approach the issue?
1314838109259878401 2020-10-10 08:00:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan Keep in mind the bulk of influential human rights organizations are influential because of their ample funding from Western governments.  That's not to say they CAN'T have valid research, but their analysis usually strongly skews to the geopolitical purposes of their funders.
1314836516850429952 2020-10-10 07:53:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @sonpal @ChengxinPan Who is the arbiter of determining whether a country is treating its citizens with respect or not? Is there an entity with a clean morals to make these judgments about other countries?  Why shouldn't Beijing be able to make decisions about natural resource development in Tibet?

While not quite as crazy, he's made a career recently forecasting the impending collapse of China.  Back in 2012 he was predicting the CPC was entering a "crisis" and would collapse within 10-15 years.
1314778403921248259 2020-10-10 04:02:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kylej_sullivan Most national leaders worldwide are, as a rule, employing rational and strategic thought as a matter of course.  Americans seem to have become so used to Trump's childlike tantrums that they've forgotten other governments and leaders aren't like that too.
1314777791380897794 2020-10-10 04:00:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kylej_sullivan I think prolonged exposure to Trump in the USA has led to a tendency for Western academics to feel comfortable describing national leaders in inappropriately intimate terms.  When the first sentence confidently states that China's leader is "in denial", it's not a good start.

1313512438344507395 2020-10-06 16:12:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Tonally it's very mild. No call to arms or "red alert". It doesn't even suggest that reducing wastage is a kind of precautionary measure.  It focuses on convincing the reader to take wastage seriously and that it's more important than ever because of current context.
1313512435534327808 2020-10-06 16:12:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The report then goes on to discuss the initiatives to reduce food wastage.  The overall gist of the paper is "look, although it seems it might not be such a big deal to waste food, it is still the correct and socially conscious thing to do, according to the facts."
1313512432900296704 2020-10-06 16:12:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Report always points out that owing to supply chain breakage and panic buying of crops, international prices of wheat are up 8% YoY; rice is up 25%. Russia has halted wheat exports. Locusts have affected crops through the Middle East and fires have affected agriculture in AUS.
1313512430144684037 2020-10-06 16:12:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> They discuss that the UN has said we are facing the "worst crisis in 50 years" of food insecurity, with at least 25 countries at risk for severe famine and 700 million facing extreme hunger.  Even in countries with good production like China, the supply chain faces breakage.
1313512427393179649 2020-10-06 16:12:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Chinese restaurant and catering food wastage rate overall is estimated to be around 11.7%, or 93 grams of food wastage per diner per meal.  Worst offenders are large banquets (estimated 38% food wastage rate) and elementary school lunches (!) (estimated 33% food wastage rate).
1313512424587231232 2020-10-06 16:12:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Many rural communities are being hollowed out by urban relocation, increasingly leaving behind just the very young or very old, who will be unable to maintain the same high agricultural production levels.  Also (side tangent) they believe they use too many pesticides per capita.
1313512421684731904 2020-10-06 16:12:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Despite strong domestic grains production this year (including +0.9% YoY summer grain crops) China must never forget that it's feeding 20% of the world's population with just 7% of the world's arable land.  [These would be data from pre-floods. Grain imports are way up right now]
1313512419000348673 2020-10-06 16:12:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Major takeaways:   In a normal year, China is self-sufficient for 97%+ of its grain, corn and rice needs, with imports usually only to provide variety.  But supply and demand are in "tight balance‚Äú Á¥ßÂπ≥Ë°° i.e. there's no large production surplus.

I know wheat imports are way up YoY and the quota nearly tripled.  Caixin article suggested domestic farmers are holding back a portion of their crop, anticipating higher prices.

The reverberations of COVID are pretty light now at this point. The outbreak here was effectively contained 5+ months ago.  B. Restaurants closing for COVID in China led to lower consumption of foodstuffs, not lower production.
1313478070939115522 2020-10-06 13:55:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @MFinChina @RavenOnthill @dom_ma @evadou Yeah, with such cheap delivery logistics in China...why would restaurants need to order bulk in advance when it's easy to get fresh produce daily?  I'm sure there's some wastage there but I expect the majority is from either the consumers or places like bakeries and buffets.

1313376093236158464 2020-10-06 07:10:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> WaPo attempts to thread together a narrative of food insufficiency based on:  1. A voluntary guideline for restaurant diners based on targeting food waste released by a city restaurant association 2. Lower domestic production of fresh food, leading to increased imports
1313376090157531136 2020-10-06 07:10:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> None of that means people are rationing food or facing food insecurity. Higher pork prices means per capita pork consumption will drop this year, absolutely. It will be replaced by other proteins, such as chicken or soy products. Imported fruit may cost a bit more...
1313376086026186752 2020-10-06 07:10:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It‚Äôs true that China‚Äôs domestic food production has taken some harsh hits this year. Floods have affected agricultural output and swine flu has decimated pig herds. To compensate, fruit and vegetable imports are up. The price of fresh pork in the supermarket has soared.
1313376082981056512 2020-10-06 07:10:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The measure is entirely voluntary and is treated as a suggestion. There are no rules for strict implementation, and no penalties if it not followed. It‚Äôs not a law, after all. It‚Äôs a guideline document from a municipal restaurant association!   https://t.co/LMxKex3EGz.
1313376079726309376 2020-10-06 07:10:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Three days later, the Wuhan Catering Association released a guideline, encouraging restaurants to offer smaller portions at lower prices and diners to use the N-1 ordering, where ‚Äú10 people should order food for 9 people. If not enough, add more later‚Äù. 10‰ΩçÁÇπ9‰∏™‰∫∫ÁöÑËèúÔºå ‰∏çÂ§üÂÜçÂä†
1313374172249120769 2020-10-06 07:02:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The anti-food waste campaign got new energy in August 2020, when Xi released a statement about food waste, calling it ‚Äúghastly to the eyes‚Äù, causing ‚Äúpain in the heart‚Äù and adding ‚Äúwho knows the hardships that were endured to put that food on your plate?‚Äù
1313374169636065280 2020-10-06 07:02:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Around that time, combating waste in government units also became a big deal. I remember dinner banquets with the vice president of some large Chinese SOEs and being surprised that he got to-go boxes for all the leftovers.
1313374166695903232 2020-10-06 07:02:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China‚Äôs been fighting food waste and bad habits for a while now. Back in 2013 I remember a big anti-food waste campaign focused on messaging in restaurants. Every small shop had signs like ‚Äúclean plate campaign‚Äù and ‚Äúfrugality is glorious, waste is despicable‚Äù.  https://t.co/lrAsEjuoWM
1313374152766570496 2020-10-06 07:02:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This can lead to low concern over waste. Some people think ‚Äúit‚Äôs my money, I paid for the food, who cares if I don‚Äôt eat?‚Äù. They might even practice Áïô‰∏ÄÁÇπ - leave some food behind intentionally. Note: Chinese grandparents‚Äô generation ÈïøËæà who lived through famine won't do this.
1313374150195470336 2020-10-06 07:02:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There‚Äôs also some traditional ordering philosophies in play like È£ûÁ¶ΩËµ∞ÂÖΩ   Â§©‰∏äÈ£ûÁöÑ, Âú∞‰∏äÁà¨ÁöÑÔºå ÂÆ∂ÈáåÂÖªÁöÑÔºå Êµ∑ÈáåÊ∏∏ÁöÑ ÈÉΩË¶ÅÊúâ ‚ÄúMust have something that flies, something that walks, something you raised, something from the sea‚Äù
1313374147553095681 2020-10-06 07:02:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There‚Äôs also the social pressure to put on a big spread for your guests and demonstrate your largesse. Some people would be concerned about losing face over not providing a sufficiently generous array of dishes.
1313374144864546816 2020-10-06 07:02:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> When ordering for 2 or 3 people, you‚Äôre usually ok with 3-5 dishes. It gets trickier with more diners. You don‚Äôt know the portion sizes. Sometimes the server hustles you into buying extra dishes. They rarely tell you that you‚Äôre ordering too much, unless you directly ask them.
1313374142230528000 2020-10-06 07:02:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Ordering food for a group is a skill. People will compliment you if you‚Äôre good at it, and hearing that you ‚Äú‰ºöÁÇπËèú‚Äù is some very solid praise.  You have to balance meat, veg, cold and hot dishes, soup, and carbs, not to mention personal likes and dislikes.
1313374139445510144 2020-10-06 07:02:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> A longish thread about food waste and over ordering at restaurants in China:  So China definitely has a problem with food waste at restaurants, especially related to banquets where everyone is sharing the dishes on the table.

1313199731590361088 2020-10-05 19:29:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @evadou "you have to order N-1"   No, you don't. This is a false claim. It's not an obligation and there is no penalty.  You can't turn this into reality just by saying it.  You made a mistake and you got caught. Retract? Or don't. But probably don't double down.
1313194507714719744 2020-10-05 19:09:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RavenOnthill @MFinChina @dom_ma @evadou It's not mandated. It's a suggestion that is not enforced with any penalties. It also was only piloted in Wuhan and one other city.   Give this up. It's not real. The reporter made a mistake and has been dunked on for over 24 hours already. No need to defend the false story.
1313035351888293888 2020-10-05 08:36:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RavenOnthill @MFinChina @dom_ma @evadou Yes, that's what we're saying - the article's statements on shortages are not supported.  There is real evidence of a campaign to reduce food waste, by encouraging diners in restaurants to order less initially and add more if they're still hungry.  No shortages, no rationing.
1313002643791310849 2020-10-05 06:26:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RavenOnthill @MFinChina @dom_ma @evadou There are no shortages. There is a campaign against food waste. There are no shortages. Jesus.

1312655537000120320 2020-10-04 07:27:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> At least the 1st friend had actually heard of it. This one in Zhengzhou embodies the more common response:  Me: Is Zhengzhou pushing the "N+1 ordering mode"? Her: What?? Me: To prevent ordering too much food and reduce the volume of food waste. Her: No. I haven't heard of this.  https://t.co/ICLWBCftAR

1312646243449929728 2020-10-04 06:50:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Her: ...habits...dining culture. Her: We put extra thought into the mix of meats and vegetables. Sometimes when you're treating guests you'll also put extra thought. Me: Would you feel bad if you treat guests and they eat everything?  Her: Nothing wrong with that. Waste is bad.
1312646240572567553 2020-10-04 06:50:26 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Me, continued: ...that there's not enough food.  Her: üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  I think China is too wasteful. Basically we always order N+1.  Me. Yes, it's very wasteful. Is it related to cultural tradition?  Her: It shouldn't be said its a cultural tradition. It's related to a lot of things...
1312646237556928513 2020-10-04 06:50:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Her: Not strict, just a recommendation. You're free to order as much as you want.  Me: Is there a penalty for not following the rules?  Her: No, it's just a recommendation. Me: Okay. You know that Western media is saying that this is because China needs to ration food....
1312646233614237696 2020-10-04 06:50:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Because some people like anecdotes, here's a chat with a Wuhan friend:  Me: I've heard Wuhan is pushing the "N-1 ordering mode". Do you know of this? Her: If you have a lot of people, you can do N-1. If you have a few people, it should be N+1 Me: Yeah. Is it strict? (continued)  https://t.co/7eo96JPmAg
1312639075543740416 2020-10-04 06:21:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @evadou @andymok Well, for those who find the higher prices unaffordable, they'll replace pork in their diet with other things and per capita consumption of pork will decrease.  I don't see the connection to a campaign against food waste.  Diners are not forbidden to order more food.
1312635846109982721 2020-10-04 06:09:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @andymok @evadou Your definition of shortage is what I would also consider to be more accurate.   At least the market is able to realign at an higher equilibrium price. The relative scarcity is real, but the market is still functioning fine.
1312618703528230914 2020-10-04 05:01:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @andymok @evadou Same. If such shortages are happening, they must be very localized.
1312618042082258945 2020-10-04 04:58:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @evadou @DoleeArts I frankly see no any evidence that "eat whatever you can afford &amp; your belly can contain" is no longer kosher.  This policy is clearly focused on reducing the volume of waste left uneaten at the end of the meal, not the volume of food that goes into each diner's stomach.
1312612570927308800 2020-10-04 04:36:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ToniKX3 @evadou It's even less strict.    https://t.co/Boe79zYAPR  "10‰∫∫ËøõÈ§êÂè™ËÉΩÂÖàÁÇπ9‰∫∫Ëèú"  10 ppl order "food for 9 ppl". Doesn't even say anything about the # of dishes.  But it if gets waiters to be more proactive in suggesting that you've over-ordered, that's great.
1312611665330880514 2020-10-04 04:33:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DoleeArts @evadou Netizens pointed out that its actual operability ÂèØÊìç‰ΩúÊÄß is very low. Who can determine what "food for 9" is vs. "food for 10"? It's not like each person has their own dish. In a dongbei restaurant, food for 10 is like...7 dishes. In a dim sum place, it would be at least 20.
1312611526692438016 2020-10-04 04:32:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DoleeArts @evadou Yes, such a policy was announced for Hubei and I found articles saying it is implemented in Zhengzhou now too.   Basically: If you are 10 people, start by ordering food as if you are 9 people. If it's not enough, add more later.  I simply don't see how this = food rationing.

1312466595118227456 2020-10-03 18:56:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @HohoChan657 Oh yeah I know, I was joking. I already blocked them both.   I've been noticing the "is that a threat?" comeback on Twitter recently...it's like they all took a class together. I wanted to give an answer he wouldn't know how to respond to.

1312460352257290242 2020-10-03 18:31:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Well I've been asking around, and I can't find a single person in this whole country that has any idea what you're talking about.  This appears to have been fabricated by the WaPo out of thin air. If it's real, there's zero manifestation of actual implementation.

They can't believe it.  Blaming China won't fix that. Never will.

Surely you know  from experience that a partially complete story can and will be treated as a dog whistle?
1312275206216450048 2020-10-03 06:16:04 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thechiefmaddog @JChengWSJ @niubi Oh shit, I just realized that you actually have no clue what you're talking about.   What the hell am I doing, talking to you? I thought you might be serious for a second. Bye.

1312274805098307584 2020-10-03 06:14:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @thechiefmaddog @JChengWSJ @niubi Ok so now you've gone from "they will collapse in 6 weeks" to "they might have problems if someday India decides to attack their trade routes". And they you include a further list of countries that would be insane to mess with Chinese crude.  that's a pretty massive backpedal.

What imaginary threat is a single aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf "protecting" China's oil imports from?  2. China's oil is for transportation, not power sector.  3. China has a massive crude stockpile anyway.  Your fantasy of Chinese fragility is just that: a fantasy.

1311689632338247684 2020-10-01 15:29:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy I want to stress that what I think doesn't matter. I'm not Chinese. My country does things equally or more worthy of criticism.  Also: I think the CHN govt has done many things very well, wants to improve its citizens lives and is not inherently evil. Don't QT me out of context.
1311663387919577089 2020-10-01 13:44:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy I do believe it's a good to honestly and assertively confront the first part but it's way over my IQ level to figure out how to curb the second part...
1311662941058428931 2020-10-01 13:43:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy Greatest challenge I see is the reconciliation of:  1. A situation of repression does exist and; 2. A seeming large and vocal portion of people who care about this issue want to leverage it for political purposes unrelated to the actual well-being of the people affected.
1311660728600862721 2020-10-01 13:34:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy The highly vocal nature of these dishonest actors is a huge discredit to the overall goal, even if their ratio is small. Their outright fabrications or obvious cold-war political machinations drive off some who would otherwise be inclined to be sympathetic and thoughtful.
1311656158269067264 2020-10-01 13:16:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy That's not to say it wasn't a carefully curated experience for foreign media. I would very much expect it was.  My point is it's impossible now for ANY observer (the media, the UN, OIC etc. to observe conditions in XJ and NOT have it be dismissed as a Potemkin village.
1311655916542980097 2020-10-01 13:15:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Dave_Brophy At this point, what kind of media tour would NOT be dismissed as Potemkin village?  The conditions China would have to submit to in order for an inquiry to be considered fair..would the USA ever accept such conditions for similar external inquiry into e.g. migrant border camps?

Two months ago they swapped me over to a stay permit instead of extending my M visa, and I just got that extended with no issues. Thought it might be tricky since my workplace is actually HK, but they weren't concerned at all.
1311632928644853760 2020-10-01 11:43:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @OBukowsky He could consider applying for a stay permit (i.e. not a visa) on either humanitarian grounds, or simply as a "visa-free" visitor?  He could argue that due to his age and what a shitshow the USA is, would be inhumane to make him return there.   ‰∫∫ÈÅì‰∏ª‰πâÂÅúÁïôÊ≠£  or  ÂÖçÁ≠æËØÅÂÅúÁïôÊ≠£

Not to mention more randomly cherry-picked quotes from Weibo, since they can't even get local interviews anymore.

The end result, I fear, is that Western media coverage of China is going to be become even MORE speculative (and vindictive).

None of the overblown drama of the other MC series and spin-offs...just serious cooks taking on appropriate challenges and doing amazing things with ingredients and skills.

1310416062752514048 2020-09-28 03:08:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Well said, both by Professor Pan and you.
1310415593909018624 2020-09-28 03:06:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Big news indeed, if its implementation is more robust than that of similar proclamations by JP infrastructure banks.
1310413161095282688 2020-09-28 02:56:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Seen a few articles making the rounds recently with much sanctimonious hand-wringing over Chinese overseas fossil fuel investments.  As always, there's more nuance to this narrative that's being ignored. CD had good coverage earlier this year:   https://t.co/GKs08uxQ06
1310410614947291136 2020-09-28 02:46:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For the most part, developing countries lack the market fundamentals, policy support, and legal systems necessary to make a credit review board comfortable with a major RE investment.  It's a bad faith point to complain about fossil fuel investments without acknowledging this.
1310410609809223685 2020-09-28 02:46:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The hesitance of Chinese banks to invest in overseas RE projects usually boils down to one of two things:   1. Project bankability. e.g. does the country have robust PPAs, low curtailment, and on-grid tariff support like RE subsidies/FiT?  2. Geo-strategic barriers  1/2
1310402845326233600 2020-09-28 02:15:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @pioangelus This is a very fair point as well
1310236669589639170 2020-09-27 15:15:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @caffein8ed_kev @GolleyJane @DanielDumbrill @HopkinsNanjing I only paid attention when you started mindlessly going after Brophy's credentials and scholarship on Xinjiang. You were out of line and you chose to double down when the wise choice was to back off and extract foot from mouth.  I don't care about the rest of the Twitter drama.
1310228829328166913 2020-09-27 14:44:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @caffein8ed_kev @GolleyJane @DanielDumbrill @HopkinsNanjing I see no indication that you are capable of nuance or depth. Given your utter lack of expertise in the subjects you are so fond of discussing, your assessment of influence or inspiration has little merit...
1310164492982956035 2020-09-27 10:28:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> And it's no big deal that the subsidies for new projects are ending, by the way. Wind and solar are as cheap or cheaper than coal in most Chinese provinces now.  Sometimes it's a good idea to just trust that the guys with PhDs in energy economics know what they're doing.
1310164490349019136 2020-09-27 10:28:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Key takeaway: Renewables are NOT being squeezed out of the Chinese power supply, and their dispatch is prioritized over coal. In particular, the subsidy-free RE projects developed from 2021 onward will be granted first right of dispatch vs. all other types of generation.
1310164480836263936 2020-09-27 10:28:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China uses TWO dispatch protocols.  9 provinces use the "Energy Savings" protocol, where renewables are always dispatched first.  The rest of the provinces use "Fair Dispatch" protocols, where quotas are used.  But the "Fair Dispatch" protocols are reforming to prioritize RE too.
1310164471231389697 2020-09-27 10:28:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From the article:  "But the new coal surge is running renewables out of the market because China's energy distribution system uses Soviet-style quotas, where power suppliers are allocated a monthly supply limit."  This was barely 50% accurate 5 years ago. Not correct now.  Thread

1310079311517372417 2020-09-27 04:50:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ColleenHuberNMD Yeah this is why your country is struggling
1310078973372637189 2020-09-27 04:49:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @captainsacks @DanielDumbrill In times like this, you wonder if they were always like this, or if it was living over here that brought out all the shitty personality characteristics they had to conceal before becoming an expat.
1310075618696949760 2020-09-27 04:35:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @OBukowsky @DanielDumbrill To be fair, ENG teachers usually make enough to live quite comfortable lives in China. The market's been inflating over the last half year because no one new is allowed in and the schools are desperate. 25/30k a month is normal now in SZ, to essentially babysit kindergarten
1310073530994757635 2020-09-27 04:27:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking Complicated question, too long for here, but an extremely relevant one. I have sent you some DMs
1310064097627496448 2020-09-27 03:49:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @nathanking Yes, and you can't even necessarily hold it against them. Credit review boards hate the conditions for RE projects in developing countries.  So many bankability issues, from weak power prices, to offtaker credit risk, to unworkable PPA terms. It's like gambling.
1309778182522900481 2020-09-26 08:53:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Zishi_Zhang And it's not like Chinese banks are the only banks in the world still funding fossil projects. If they didn't lend to those projects, there are SK and Japanese banks just waiting to leap in (with higher interest rates).  But that's too complex of a breakdown for these guys.
1309771938940690432 2020-09-26 08:28:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Japanese environmentalists have certainly has struggled to get their banks to stop financing fossil projects around the world, for instance.    https://t.co/xhaJst3lCP
1309771001991892994 2020-09-26 08:25:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 And of course, as you point out, it's not like the Chinese banks are holding Vietnam or other BRI countries at gunpoint, forcing them to accept loans for coal plans. Most often these are local developers with already-planned projects, searching for capital.
1309770588488003586 2020-09-26 08:23:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 Now if we want to push for Chinese policy banks and commercial banks to make commitments NOT to fund any more fossil fuel projects in developing countries, that could indeed be a feasible course of action, but they would have to be some of the first in the world.
1309769651883134977 2020-09-26 08:19:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 I'm working on a significant BRI energy exports project right now.  I challenge Mike Forsythe or any China watcher environmental pundit to name a country where Chinese developers have attractive and economically feasible opportunities for solar/wind and aren't chasing them.

In which case, perhaps his opinion is founded on more concrete evidence than yours is, and is more justified, and not cause for moral outrage.

1305759918184513537 2020-09-15 06:46:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DanielDumbrill You know, I don't even think they necessarily do this knowingly.  I mean yes, sometimes nefarious intent can clearly be demonstrated, and its easy to see it's on purpose, but I think a lot of the the time they are actually oblivious to their own biases and flawed framing.
1305727024137269248 2020-09-15 04:35:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> In this China Expert's world, the reason for launching a campaign against food waste is...unrelated to food waste, naturally.  Because China is Bad, and would never do anything sensible.  Therefore, it's obviously an indication of nefarious Chinese economic doomsday prep.
1305724955565334528 2020-09-15 04:27:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @vshih2 STILL trying to spin this into a "China Bad" story, complete with this pathetically weak analysis in the quote.  What do you expect from someone arrogant enough to describe themselves as "an expert of China elite politics"?  I'm not even shocked by this anymore, just sad.

1305407432286326789 2020-09-14 07:25:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim If someone says to me "hey laowai, come over here" - i.e. using it as a placeholder for my name, or instead of "sir", I find it a bit annoying, sure, but it's not intended as a pejorative.  All other usages are totally fine for me...

They were good, but seemed very comparable to the best available in Shanghai (Lillian Bakery) or the aforementioned KFC tarts which are also quite nice.

Perfect with espresso.  KFC tart recipe is from Margaret's in Macau right? Eggy, way less sugar, firmer custard. No cinnamon.  Different products for different people :)

1305137507919515648 2020-09-13 13:33:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nite_wolfus A few years back, someone from Hungary corrected me when I said "those of us from Western backgrounds..." - told me that he considers himself to be Eastern.  Since then, I've been asking eastern Europeans out of habit whenever I meet them, and many say they are part of the East.

That means there's at 80 people out there following this hack who think he knows what he's talking about, and want to amplify his message to their entire follower base. WTF.
1304858723324551168 2020-09-12 19:05:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ZhangTaisu @niubi ...at least ONE situation where China's system created a better outcome, and that's not something the American consciousness is ready to accept. It's an attack on American identity itself to admit that our system was flawed and inferior to any other's, but ESPECIALLY China's.
1304830542181888001 2020-09-12 17:13:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @NavinaHeyden Ah cool. If you do it again, you can try adding a little splash of ËÄÅÊäΩ on top of the ÁîüÊäΩ to get that deep brown color.  Now I'm hungry.

But if you were using a VPN to distribute pornography online, then you would be charged for both violations (that was one of the cases I saw in the forum post)
1304796379093426177 2020-09-12 14:57:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @captainsacks @ThingsReallyR @Reuters It's like having an (illegal) second rider on your scooter in Shanghai.  Cops usually won't stop you just for for the extra rider.  But the cop catches you making an illegal turn, with an extra rider on the back, now you're getting a ticket for both.
1304795354345267200 2020-09-12 14:53:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ThingsReallyR @captainsacks @Reuters About 10% of Chinese internet users employ VPNs regularly. There are laws about "employing illegal software to pursue illegal behaviors online" (paraphrase) but are very rarely applied.

He was not the first to be assaulted. This wasn't the first day of mob violence.  Your bias is showing. You can't justify it.
1304139498402373632 2020-09-10 19:27:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Imagine being the most successful and impressive modern infrastructure-building country on the planet and having some Bloomberg Opinion writer opine that your country is going to be crippled by floods.  While calling "5G a bridge to nowhere".  Can't tell if arrogance or jealousy.
1304089160676859910 2020-09-10 16:07:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim By all accounts I'm hearing, it seems to be pretty shit, for reasons unrelated to politics, so I was gonna give it a pass anyway.

I remember reading an article a few years ago that mentioned "Mehmet" was still fine, although Muhammad was not -the first considered a "normal" Uyghur name and the other verboten.

1303538876099653632 2020-09-09 03:41:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim Everything about this guy oozes gross, from his Chinese name that he surely can't pronounce, to his "but my HK wife" as his first line of debate, to obnoxious flags in the bio, to constant white savior complex, to obvious anti-Mainland bigotry. His kind will be extinct soon.
1303533799435722752 2020-09-09 03:20:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GMOChannel Practically speaking, there are still some holes in SZ 5G coverage. I've seen the telecoms' coverage maps.   Each tower can only cover a circle around it, and the circles don't overlap, so there's always a few gaps in random locations when talking around on the street.
1303531014644326401 2020-09-09 03:09:46 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @derznovich Not sure why this recent of a study would use 2017 CEC data? CEC has published curtailment data up to Q2 2020 already.
1303530691821408256 2020-09-09 03:08:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @derznovich Hydro, solar, and wind curtailment have all come down drastically since 2017 - basically like looking at a different country now.  Capacity growth was severely restricted for all generation types until demand caught up a bit. Coal has taken a hit too I think.
1303404635378475010 2020-09-08 18:47:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @free67847229 Someone else asked this too. But I can only answer as vaguely as I did before.    https://t.co/0xOy2CP8w9
1303373506936147968 2020-09-08 16:43:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Tedder130 TEPCO had conducted internal studies and contracted external analyses and failed to act on the recommendations of their consultants and technical service providers.  External flooding risk assessments are definitely done differently now in Japan...   https://t.co/IlE1tTnafx
1303372095326306304 2020-09-08 16:38:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @IcyGreenForest Exactly.  If people knew half the work that went into designing safety for airplanes and nuclear power plants, they'd be far less scared of those, and more scared of the true killers: automobile accidents and fossil fuel-induced respiratory diseases.
1303371103079813120 2020-09-08 16:34:21 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChrisW_1122 @Xanavi22 I would imagine it depends on the type of missile, the speed, and the accuracy, among other things.  The firm that used to be my client (from which I learned this stuff) also did missile impact work for the USG with some labs in the US. Obviously I was not privy to the details :)
1303345097006702592 2020-09-08 14:51:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Xanavi22 Hopefully it gives you peace of mind to sleep at night, if you were worried about airplanes hitting power plants :p
1303344266278662144 2020-09-08 14:47:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @DiscourseFrank I agree the situation has changed.  The author is still active in media today   https://t.co/z4rOU5Dr8J  I guess he's about as close to a 'model minority' as you can get, but also his article showed that he and his family were outliers, in the face of great pressure.
1303339461598560261 2020-09-08 14:28:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This is a very interesting article and useful breakdown. It's a totally different world out there now...
1303287147122708481 2020-09-08 11:00:44 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ConcernedHk You can learn everything you need to know about this guy from his Quora history, which is full of disinformation, anti-China bigotry, white saviorship and general arrogance.

1303202236235878400 2020-09-08 05:23:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> This has been reason #9001 why civil engineers are much cooler than they ever get credit for.  Thank an engineer today! üòÑ
1303202233526267904 2020-09-08 05:23:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Every nuke plant in the world has now completed this analysis and new reactor designs must be qualified for AIA before they are approved by regulators.  Aircraft impact is just one of the external risks plant designers have to consider, alongside flood, earthquake, tsunami, etc..
1303202230867091456 2020-09-08 05:23:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> There are only a few companies in the world that can perform this analysis, and their methodologies and results are highly confidential and subject to national security laws.  After all, one of the outcomes of this analysis is the identification of the most vulnerable points!
1303202228124098561 2020-09-08 05:23:18 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3. Will the vibrations/shaking caused by the impact outside affect any internal electronic equipment, causing it to be inoperable?  This is tested via shaker tables, with identified vulnerable equipment getting mounted on vibration dampers of some kind.
1303202225410330624 2020-09-08 05:23:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2. If the jet's fuel ignites and causes a pressurized fireball on the outside of the containment shell, will that fireball be able to enter the facilities via exhaust vents and other apertures and cause internal damage to the facility?  Fire spread modeling is used for this.
1303202222696660993 2020-09-08 05:23:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The analysis covers three areas:  1. Can the reactor's concrete containment shell withstand the physical force of the airplane's impact (specifically the engines, the densest part of the aircraft)?  Advanced concrete modeling is used for this, backed up by testing at Sandia.
1303202216665260033 2020-09-08 05:23:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Since 9/11, owners of nuclear power plants have been required to conduct safety margin analysis in the event of an accidental or intentional collision between a passenger jet and a nuclear power facility.  This highly specialized field is called Aircraft Impact Analysis (AIA).
1303202213871853568 2020-09-08 05:23:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Have you ever wondered what happens if an airplane is used to target a nuclear power plant?   Civil engineers in the nuclear power industry have.  A thread:
1303180296301416448 2020-09-08 03:56:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> For everyone who voted: it's 2007. 14 trillion USD.  Since then, the US economy has ballooned up to 20 trillion+, growth of ~30% over 13 years.  We all know where that growth was, and whom it benefited most.

1303164215822184453 2020-09-08 02:52:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aadilbrar @DanielDumbrill I'm not interested in a "blanket pass". No country deserves that. I just want objectivity, which Western media consistently fails to deliver on China, despite the trappings of 'free press.'  Officially, it's CPC, not CCP - worth noting in the future as a journalist.
1303159357769543682 2020-09-08 02:32:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @CarlZha There was an interesting point to be made with different wording.  Pessimism is not the same as "hesitance to embrace the braggadocious confidence exemplified by the Americans".   The latter phrase would have been far more accurate of an observation but broken the parallelism.
1303157768308707329 2020-09-08 02:26:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @aadilbrar @DanielDumbrill You just have to have interest in a modicum of objectivity when you report on China issues, instead of rushing like a rabid dog after "China bad" stories because your editors will give you bonuses for negative coverage.

1302874795957088256 2020-09-07 07:42:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nite_wolfus From my personal experience cooking, if I plan to use MSG, I add it first to make the food È¶ô and a little Âí∏ and then add additional salt until it's ÂèàÈ¶ôÂèàÂí∏.  If I add salt first and then MSG, I find i often over-season it (too salty).
1302872856225656837 2020-09-07 07:34:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nite_wolfus A lot of packaged foods with MSG also contain very high added sodium, so it may be hard to tell.

China's 3-year approval gap is not, as your article suggests, due to consideration in Beijing on what kind of reactor technology to use, or concern over trade issues with the US.

If you just finished watching Tenet, there's no such thing as "weapons-grade Plutonium-241".  Pu-241 has a half-life of just 14 years and decays to the gamma-emitting Am-241.

1300276318727143425 2020-08-31 03:36:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> From some of the pretty vague descriptions of verboten behaviors, however, it's easy to see how:  A. It would be easy to accidentally fall on the wrong side of those clauses, and  B. Local officials would have broad power to interpret what behaviors are or are not acceptable.
1300276312758579201 2020-08-31 03:36:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's from the national Anti-Terrorism Law  Looks like it provides legal basis for taking administrative actions against "mildly illegal" behaviors without formalizing the behaviors as Crimes and the offenders Criminals, which would likely affect employment chances post-punishment

The lenders are skeezy as fuck about it too. Constantly offering you deals to REDUCE your monthly payment, which of course extends repayment tenor.  It's as predatory as healthcare.  And that's saying something.

My loans were all federally-backed Stafford loans - subsidized were at 3.5-4% and the unsubsidized ones were 5.5-6%.  These were for my BA and MA combined.  Scholarships/grants covered 75% of my BA and 50% of my MA and I still had 82k...
1299963256002342915 2020-08-30 06:52:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino I graduated with 82k USD in loans. I broke the wheel, by starting my career in China and having my expenses extremely low, paying off 1.5k USD per month, sometimes more. I was debt free for my 30th birthday.   No question that would have been impossible in the US.

And that doubting it is unpatriotic.
1299605523025649664 2020-08-29 07:11:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @honglilai Even with the higher degree of leeway in our school, few of the NJU professors took advantage of the environment to adjust their curriculum away from what they'd have taught to a group of NJU students.  This was kinda sensitive material and had to be taught in the 'correct' way.
1299603425580048384 2020-08-29 07:02:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @honglilai I had a class for my degree called ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁé∞‰ª£Âåñ‰∏≠ÁöÑÁ§æ‰ºöÈóÆÈ¢ò at NJU, where we talked about such things, but the professor was inclined to lay the blame on imbalanced or poorly-executed policies, rather than the fundamental structural faults that allowed such mistakes to be made.
1299601127445463040 2020-08-29 06:53:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @honglilai I feel like a better understanding of Êù°Âùó would help so many "China Watchers" get over their inability to reconcile local government policies with Beijing's platforms.

1299596054032130048 2020-08-29 06:33:39 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @gonglei89 @honglilai I imagine it's related to why any rural area or small town in the world has trouble retaining talent - there's always better opportunities and more money elsewhere. Domestic brain drain.

The rooms are lovely, the food is good, and his customer service instinct is impeccable.   He is now renovating to expand some of the rooms into suites with bigger balconies.
1298966665409961985 2020-08-27 12:52:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> His location was good, close to the exit for the cable car. After 6 years of selling BBQ meats on the mountaintop, he saved up enough money by last year for a down payment to build a 20-room guesthouse in the village.  No hospitality experience at all. Zero(!!)
1298966661341384706 2020-08-27 12:52:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> The owner of the guesthouse seemed to be about my age, a local (ethnic minority).  He never went to college and left the village after school, going to work in Guangdong for a few years.  When he came back, he opened a stall selling BBQ meats at the mountain peak.

1298521879762759681 2020-08-26 07:25:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cod785115 Yes deferred. There was a lag for the completed project to be formally entered into the subsidy catalogue, and then a further lag for the project to receive its first subsidy payouts.
1298456390738964487 2020-08-26 03:05:02 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cagebird9724 I haven't seen any case showing that subsidies wouldn't be honored. Subsidy delay risk is much more relevant than subsidy default risk.  Last week they announced a new bond issuance plan to help tide over the struggling developers. I haven't read the details closely yet though.
1298448741049880576 2020-08-26 02:34:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 13/13 By 2030, wind and solar electrons for new-build plants will be not just competitive, but significantly cheaper than coal-fired power in nearly every province in China.  Old projects with their 20-year guaranteed subsidies will really look like gold mines by then.
1298448738235555840 2020-08-26 02:34:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 12/13 They can afford terrible cashflow in their RE unit in the short-term, as they've got deep pockets and can wait for the subsidies to eventually arrive in a few years.  Smaller developers on the other hand have it rough. Some, like the private GCL have been offloading assets.
1298448727162552320 2020-08-26 02:34:35 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 11/13 Many older RE projects are super cash-poor right now as they're only getting partial payment for their electrons: i.e. the portion from the grid company, but NOT their subsidy, which is delayed.  Now this is not so much of a problem for the huge SOE generators...
1298448720803979265 2020-08-26 02:34:33 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/13 Getting rid of the national subsidies is important, not just for pushing industry independence, but also they are expensive. China built SO MUCH wind and solar that the subsidy fund is totally overdrawn. It's financed by an end-user surcharge and collections can't keep up.
1298448714751606784 2020-08-26 02:34:32 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/13 Starting from 2021, all new-build solar and wind projects must be "grid parity", i.e. they will receive the same price for their power as a coal genco would (unless the province offers subsidies, which is a thing).   Maturing the whole industry past subsidies is a HUGE DEAL.
1298448708111970304 2020-08-26 02:34:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/13 Actually, taking away the subsidies means that China has gotten so good at building solar and wind and brought the costs of project development down so much, that new solar and wind projects in most locations can now be profitable at the coal tariff level, WITHOUT subsidies.
1298448705410838528 2020-08-26 02:34:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/13 This leads to those sanctimonious observations you'll often hear about Chinese RE (always from those unqualified to comment):  "Why are they getting rid of subsidies? China needs to keep building solar and wind! China needs to take its carbon reduction commitments seriously"
1298448700205801473 2020-08-26 02:34:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/13 Back in the early days of Chinese RE development (early 2010s), subsidy levels were very high. This made sense, as RE development costs were also high. As technological advances and economies of scale took effect, costs came down and subsidies dropped to very low levels.
1298448697420730368 2020-08-26 02:34:28 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/13 When we talk about solar and wind having subsidies, it means they are earn MORE for their electrons than coal gets.  The gridco pays the RE genco only the amount they'd pay for coal. A government fund subsidizes on top of that. The fund gets money from an end-user surcharge.
1298448694715416576 2020-08-26 02:34:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/13 Chinese power industry on-grid tariffs are set by coal, with RE tariffs pegged to the coal tariff. The regulated on-grid tariff level is set at a level that allows coal power gencos a "reasonable" profit margin. For an SOE genco in China, this is deemed to be 8%.
1298448683600470016 2020-08-26 02:34:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/13 A market tariff, on the other hand, is determined by supply and demand. The trade value of the electrons is negotiated between generators and buyers.   China's market mechanism is growing as part of market reform, but RE still uses almost entirely regulated tariffs.
1298448680802906112 2020-08-26 02:34:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/13 The selling price can be one of two things: a regulated tariff, or a market-derived tariff. A regulated tariff just means the government has a policy defining how much you're allowed to sell your electrons to the gridco for. This is called the "on-grid price".

1298282355413532673 2020-08-25 15:33:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Thian_Low @AlistairsWorld Village residents are automatically enrolled in "profit sharing" for the fees collected at the entrance of the scenic area and for the cable car to the peak. They are compensated according to the size of their family and acreage of the field area they own and maintain.
1298281844903837698 2020-08-25 15:31:27 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Thian_Low @AlistairsWorld It probably cuts both ways...  This village is kind of a special situation though.

But that your neighbors would probably snitch on you for breaking lockdown, so it was best to just stay at home and wait.

I think this is technically down season. The rice is growing and the locals are free to do other stuff before the tourist rush in the fall, when fields turn yellow.
1298084745008435200 2020-08-25 02:28:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @OBukowsky He also told me that many families slaughtered their pig in preparation for their family members to return from outside for the CNY holiday. But since those family members were blocked from returning, they had way too much and ate nothing but pork for a few weeks.

Fortunately they grow and raise everything they need here. He said he watched 60 movies in that time.   There were no cases reported in this county.

Or perhaps you would like to hear from Chinese Muslims from other parts of China?    https://t.co/05R32kqy4B  This Chinese Muslim lives in Hong Kong.

If you want to say practice of Islam in Xinjiang is heavily suppressed, I can agree with you.  If you say Islam is banned in China, I simply can't agree with you, because it's not true at all, and easy to disprove...
1296026932081901575 2020-08-19 10:11:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim Keep reporting the offending accounts- it's easy to demonstrate targeted harassment in this case.
1296024071168126977 2020-08-19 09:59:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RaiyanBangla @fakiho @etherial0 @cjwerleman Muslims outside of Xinjiang, especially the largest Muslim minority in China (the Hui people) are mostly unaffected by the Xinjiang policies.  This situation is about Xinjiang, not about Muslims in China. Important difference.  Islam is not banned in China.

1295984398655819776 2020-08-19 07:22:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But considering this is the host country's first coal-fired plant, and considering China has experience building and operating literally 1000s of GWs of coal plant capacity domestically...my money's on operational fault, or local subcontractor issues.
1295983763667554304 2020-08-19 07:19:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Which is not to say that this plant hasn't had its share of accidents and shutdowns, at least from 2010-2015, but at it's hard to ID whether these issues are caused by construction issues or operation issues.    https://t.co/PLeqoKb83I

1295982426242482176 2020-08-19 07:14:23 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @SCMPNews Chinese-built plant didn't have the technical failure.  It tripped following a technical failure at a different, 300 MW oil-fired plant.  This is quite clear in the article body, so this headline is very misleading.
1295981919780212737 2020-08-19 07:12:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> What a stupid headline.  The plant that had the technical fault was a locally-built 300 MW oil-fired plant.  Its shutdown caused a grid imbalance that led the Chinese-built 900 MW coal-fired plant to trip (i.e. go into emergency shutdown).  Chinese plant behaved normally.

1295729535191638016 2020-08-18 14:29:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cod785115 Yes going forward they'll be pegged to the base price of coal, which is strictly speaking, a regulated tariff, although starting from this year, it has a floating component that is adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of fuel. So not a true merchant market, but comparable.
1295724978407604231 2020-08-18 14:11:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @jeffreyjamestv I mean clearly Penfold's marketing and promotions team is employing a few very hard workers, so good on them. But I'm not sure they've made "Wine from Oz" part of their branding. I'll check next time in the store.
1295724523757633537 2020-08-18 14:09:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @jeffreyjamestv In my book, any wine sold by the 12-pack at Sam's Club (as Penfold's is) has to be viewed with a highly arched eyebrow.

But briefly:   RE projects 2020-earlier: 20yr FiT (i.e. base rate + subsidy) COD 2021 onward: grid parity with coal benchmark rate  Biggest wind generators mostly SOEs. Solar is a mix.
1295688162883194881 2020-08-18 11:45:05 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @cod785115 The storage story will definitely be the subject of a future thread, if I can keep this up. In short: battery yes, hydrogen no. RE + battery is still very expensive though...more than even gas.
1295685500653592578 2020-08-18 11:34:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kylechen_ Thanks man! Trying to take a small break from Tweeting politics for a change - we'll see how it goes...
1295683878464585728 2020-08-18 11:28:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 10/10 China's dispatch protocols will get better as big data is applied in the power sector. While it will always be difficult to compete with the efficiency of small grids like SG, China is well on-track to have the world's 'smartest' LARGE grid within 10 years IMO.
1295683870239502336 2020-08-18 11:28:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 9/10 Curtailment is much less pronounced in provinces that don't have a generation quota for coal. In these provinces, power is dispatched according to an economic merit order, with the cheapest dispatched first. Expensive generators will theoretically be forced out eventually.
1295683864644313089 2020-08-18 11:28:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 8/10 From 2016-2019, approvals for new capacity in the NW and NE grids were slashed to help demand catch up to supply and combat curtailment, and it was working.  With reduced power demand in 2020 (COVID), curtailment has returned to some degree, although not as bad as before.
1295683861741879296 2020-08-18 11:27:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 7/10 When the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, but the grid isn't purchasing their power, that generation is wasted (unless storage is available). This is called curtailment. For several years, it was a major concern for renewable generators and investors in China.
1295683855609806848 2020-08-18 11:27:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 6/10 The issue is that some (not all) Chinese provinces follow a quota dispatch policy, whereby all generators are guaranteed a certain number of operating hours in a year. The grid is required to buy power from all the generators equally. Including coal.
1295683852363395073 2020-08-18 11:27:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 5/10 In a perfect economic world, power is purchased by the grid from generators according to marginal cost, and solar/wind power, with a marginal cost near 0, would always get dispatched as long as the sun is shining/wind is blowing. But this doesn't always happen in China.
1295683848181698560 2020-08-18 11:27:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 4/10 This power glut is due to renewables, specifically wind in the NE and both wind and solar in the NW. These regions have great natural resources of wind and solar but relatively weak local consumption of power . Even after ex-region export, they still have too much power.
1295683843626696704 2020-08-18 11:27:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 3/10 The overall balance of China's power sector is indeed of oversupply, but this is not true on a regional basis. The East and South grids specifically have very tight local supply and are net importers of power from other grids. Meanwhile the NW and NE grids have a huge glut.
1295683837888884736 2020-08-18 11:27:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> 2/10 These grids are somewhat interconnected with Ultra High Voltage (UHV) lines. UHV DC lines are used for long-distance connections and UHV AC lines for shorter distances. So power can be moved around the country, but at a cost, and lines have load limits.
1295683833908453377 2020-08-18 11:27:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> China Power Sector For Dummies- Part 1: Grids and Dispatch - Getting Smarter  1/10 First, Chinese doesn't have a national grid, at least not in the way that small countries do. There are 6 regional grids (N, NE, NW, E, C, S). State Grid runs 5 of them and Southern Grid runs 1.
1295608395379011585 2020-08-18 06:28:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @jeffreyjamestv Ask your average middle class Chinese consumer (i.e. non-aficionados) to name three countries that produce wine...

It's more of a strategic diversification for energy security and a gentle easing of the pressure on coal for baseload power, rather than a play for mass scale, at least now.

China will keep building coal though, as nuclear capacity additions can't keep up with demand growth, and hydro is basically already tapped out. Baseload (as opposed to peaking) capacity needs to rise to meet demand growth, separate from intermittent solar/wind  The end.

Once these indigenous 3G designs see successful grid connection (estimated 2021), they will be cleared for mass deployment. We would then expect to see tons of more nuclear approved for construction.

During this time period, China completed design of its own 3G reactor called the HPR1000, aka Hualong One ÂçéÈæô‰∏ÄÂè∑.

So now China wants to build more 3G reactors, but the AP1000 looks like it might be a lame duck, prone to cost and build overruns. The pilot French 3G reactor they built was also slow to build and expensive. So...what to do?

All this time, China had suspended approvals of new reactors, because they were waiting for the pilot 3G projects to finish. A few previously-approved projects were grandfathered in, but otherwise the industry went very quiet and we all waited for the AP1000s.

Although China had lots of experience building 2G reactors, the design was incomplete and had bugs, the suppliers had problems with major equipment issues, and the construction timeline lagged. 5 year construction timeline became 8-9.

With the Fukushima accident in 2011, China determined to never build any more 2G reactors (like the ones that failed in Fukushima) and only build brand new 3G reactors, which couldn't have such meltdowns. Pilot project first, then mass deployment.

These days, nearly every child you bump into on the streets of a 1/2 tier city will strike up a conversation with you in English, as long as they aren't too shy.

1293763436627730435 2020-08-13 04:16:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Frawzt Depending on the volume of content created, it could help a lot for scalability.  You could have multiple videos in the workflow, especially if you want to lean into the written content.  Could have one in writing/production, one filming, and one editing, all at the same time.

Great race to the bottom.   At least she has a choice.

It's not witty. It's not a response It's irrelevant. That's why her response is dumb. That's why she's being RTed to hell. That's why your defense of it is facepalm.

1293590372417855489 2020-08-12 16:49:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @LetsBlameChina I learned from playing Cities: Skylines that you can't have two ramps that close to each other on a roundabout (the two roads on the bottom). It will create a traffic jam at the point where the entering cars have to cross lanes with the exiting cars. Funny to see it in real life.
1293448944047910914 2020-08-12 07:27:14 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @melissakchan @RealSexyCyborg Every time a foreigner says "Ah ha! You're using Twitter! In China!

1293439454107983872 2020-08-12 06:49:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Silmarillion88 @ftsnakes You can do a 1:1 translation of Mandarin into Cantonese and it will be readable. But the syntax will be inauthentic for a native Cantonese speaker.   There are also a few (I'm not sure how many exactly) characters that only are used in Cantonese. Like Âí© or Âíó or Âîî or ÂíÅ
1293438034294140929 2020-08-12 06:43:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ftsnakes Is Spanish a dialect of French or Italian or Portuguese? They're more similar than Mando and Canto.

1293436480803581952 2020-08-12 06:37:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 @Truth2Upeople Han is a very loosely defined "ethnicity". I don't take it super seriously to be honest.   Just travel around NE China and see the 1.85m guys who have "Han" on their ID card, and then travel in SW China with the 1.65m guys who also have "Han" on their ID card.   Yeah sure...

1293208509136302080 2020-08-11 15:31:49 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Secret_Beijing I was in Beijing at that time. I remember thinking it might be a fun evening to go for a jog in the rain and found myself wading through knee-deep water in Dongzhimen. Supposedly the street drains hadn't been maintained in a very long time and were completely clogged.

If you like your food sweet and light, stay in southern Jiangsu (e.g. Wuxi).  If you like it saucier and heavier, go to northern Jiangsu, where the food is basically part of Shandong cuisine (e.g. Xuzhou). This area less rich though.

As long as your fingers move around in the correct quadrant of the character for a few strokes, in the right order, it gives you all the benefit of the doubt....  Now go practice Êó• and Êõ∞ ;)

For years the flagship Xiaomi product would cost just about 2200 CNY at launch.   But the Mi Pro 5G cost 4400!  And I, like a good Á±≥Á≤â, bought it anyway, and I love it of course. But yeah...not so cheap anymore.

The former is annoyed by the latter as well.

1291690537703989248 2020-08-07 10:59:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nytimes In the China article, you make it a story about the flaws of the Chinese justice system.  In the US story, you  make it a personal human interest story - no systemic issues.  If you had a smidgen of interest in honest reporting, this wouldn't happen.  Check your biases seriously.

1291376528698171393 2020-08-06 14:12:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @junixu I look at the gap between the cities and the rural areas, not the development level of the cities.  I remember noting in South Korea the development gap between rural areas and cities was similar to the US.  Development gap between Chinese cities and countryside much wider.

It's that "their beliefs deviate so substantially from what we'd consider healthy societal views that it's prudent to perhaps not immediately take their claims at face value".

Supposedly China ceased the practice but I dunno  Obviously FLG doesn't think so of course. They've gotten a lot of mileage from that narrative and aren't likely to let it go.

There's a different tolerance level that leads to different sensitivity.  I'm sure more than a few people wish the WBC could be illegal and membership a crime, like Nazism in Germany.

They get a pulpit in the West because they're anti-China.

But it only can work if the retailers are well regulated. China is experimenting with this right now.

GOP thinks the liberal media is biased, and Dems think conservative media is biased - that's what this is showing.  They still think their chosen media platform is A-ok.

Henan is weird though. 5th largest GDP in 2019 but relatively low penetration of internet users.

1290631108304834561 2020-08-04 12:50:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @TomBaxter17 most target countries don't have robust subsidy frameworks, power dispatch mechanisms or long-term RE PPA options to give peace of mind to the financing institutions from a risk perspective. At the end of the day, they still want to make money on these investments.

1289416283616731136 2020-08-01 04:22:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @GroseTimothy He has 15k followers on Twitter and 90k followers on YT. Why wouldn't you want to take advantage of the larger audience? Why wouldn't he?  I think this is an opportunity missed. There's a big world of bad faith actors out there, but it's mistaken to assume that Daniel is one.

Knowing which battles to pick is an important part of being an effective defender of China.  Not all hills are worth dying on.

China expat Twitter often feels like an echo chamber of white experiences. Surely black expats have nuance or entirely different experiences to share?

China expat Twitter is very, very white, as you may have noticed, and the experiences of black people in China, no matter where they hail from, would be educational for me.

If you assign a HK/TW second-gen with limited China knowledge and very shaky Mandarin to report on issues in China, it looks like an attempt to legitimize a white western perspective by using an Asian messenger.

"TikTok is used for spying" is a well-known allegation. It's not itself well-known.  I'd be a bit more more concerned what Google or Facebook know about me than what TikTok would know about me (if I used it).

1288520712873897984 2020-07-29 17:04:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hkdetester At the very uncertain outbreak, we actually lived in HK for 2 weeks, in case borders suddenly closed and had to make a break for it.  Originally planned to go Macau after but we were barred from entry (gf birthplace in Hubei) and got bounced back to SZ.  All part of the plan ;)
1288519830744625155 2020-07-29 17:00:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ecocktimes Kind of liking being a secular conservative in the USA? lol
1288519721956962306 2020-07-29 17:00:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ecocktimes It's impossible to find a venue to express our more nuanced views on China. If you get the opposition camp a tiny opening, they'll go crazy with it.   And I'm no political ideologue...definitely not an ML, so often feel I'm part of splinter cell within the "pro-China" camp.
1288518313690058752 2020-07-29 16:54:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @hkdetester But does this matter at all for foreign passport holders? As far as I understand, it means I can go to Macau and still can't come back... Yippee

You must know that even on a spectrum of China-haters, you exist in the extreme right wing of that spectrum.  You might want to consider sticking to whatever it is you do as a day job. Because political commentary does not suit you.

1288336992497831936 2020-07-29 04:54:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JonSchw73589513 @gonglei89 @RonPauliticsJS China is fighting what it views as a battle for its own territory. You can disagree that this is in fact its own territory. I do too.  But it's totally different from sending warships across the world, nowhere near your own borders.  No comparison at all. No moral equivalence.

Your profile pic makes it very clear where your allegiances lie, which is ok, but don't pretend you're being very objective here, because you aren't...

America thinks it can get away with everything. Now that it's challenged, it's looking to start a war.  On what grounds does America hold the right to 'change behavior.'  You know Team America: World Police was a parody, right?
1288333048006578176 2020-07-29 04:38:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @RonPauliticsJS @gonglei89 The United States IS a blood-lusting, imperialist power. The only actual point of doubt is whether war w/ China is likely (which I agree it isn't).  Listing the reality of USA foreign interference and invasions since 1949 is effective propaganda by itself. No need to embellish.
1288330817710637056 2020-07-29 04:29:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mattsheehan88 It's laborious, but I would just go to the source policy docs - that's what we've done at work.  I haven't seen any really concise English summary or commentary on it. Probably because it's still somewhat abstract now, or perhaps because everyone is distracted by other topics.

1288327722599555078 2020-07-29 04:17:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JosepLawson @Yang_Aotearoa This is a misplaced statement I think. China's soft power has increased steadily over the last 20-30 years. In the past it enjoyed lower levels of int'l ill-will. That's different.   Framing China as the enemy of the West is what has increased significantly in the past 3-4 years.

Acadian became shortened to "Cajun".  The ones that stayed behind can be found in Canadian maritime provinces and northern Maine.   We have potatoes and moose.    https://t.co/MaPLdS0ROO

The northern half of the state is very rural. Lot of farming, hunting, fishing, pick-up trucks, and country music. We are a strange, French speaking, Catholic offshoot of the American South.
1288122359497465856 2020-07-28 14:41:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant @samdunningo Very useful share - thanks!
1288080563346145280 2020-07-28 11:55:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo P.S. the title will come out really weird in Google Translate, because he refers to America as the "hacker empire", which also happens to be the Chinese name for The Matrix.  The author's nom de plume is ÈíüÂ£∞which translates as "the sound of bells" in English.
1288079970367991814 2020-07-28 11:52:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo The opinion piece was obviously...quite aggressive. But it's worth noting that the author focused on "some American politicians" rather than about the entire political system or government. You can feed it into Google Translate for the basic gist:   https://t.co/Ta7248qzVE
1288079199857602560 2020-07-28 11:49:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo The BLM protests piece was also very factual and I didn't catch any loaded wording. But then again the situation is pretty bad right now...if you want to propagandize bad things about the USA, straight reporting is effective enough...   https://t.co/Euaslwvmsb
1288078251403833344 2020-07-28 11:46:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo The consulate closure piece was very short and factual with no analysis or discussion, like a press release. I have a feeling this was passed down from central gov't to prevent any editors from going off script and they just straight publish it.
1288077637663916034 2020-07-28 11:43:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo Back! Read 3 articles from today's People's Daily including Chengdu consulate closure, BLM protest coverage and opinion piece on US-China relations.  My first impression is that the news is reported very, very straight. They save all their invective for the opinion section.
1288068213561946113 2020-07-28 11:06:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo Ah well...I'll admit that I don't consume Chinese language media as much as I could.  If they're saving all the juicy emotional and confrontational language for Chinese eyes only, then I guess I've been missing out. Let me go take a look at People's Daily.
1288064457646645248 2020-07-28 10:51:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo It's more apparent when you set out looking for it.  You can try looking at the last 10 WaPo or NYT articles on China and highlight what you see as emotionally loaded or biased language in the title or lede. Then do the same for CGTN and compare the count. You may be surprised?
1288062870643564544 2020-07-28 10:44:54 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo 1. Well certainly more historically, I'd say rare today. If you were accusing of being a "rightist" during the CR, then you were toast.  2. Sure, the negative bias won't always be overt or even conscious. That goes back to my original post about the media framing.
1288061595424133120 2020-07-28 10:39:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo I agree, the "mainstream" is a carefully curated band of what's acceptable, and you're far more likely to be criticized if you step too far right than if you step too far left.
1288060038930604032 2020-07-28 10:33:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo "Capitalist" is not used as a political attack in China the way "communist" is used in the United States.  The West views socialism with condescension, arrogance, and hatred.  China's views on liberal democracy can't possibly match that level of emotion. More like skepticism.
1288059150430138368 2020-07-28 10:30:07 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @samdunningo This is kinda true for more hawkish Chinese factions...the Global Times readers for instance.  But I consider the "mainstream" Chinese view on the West to be more moderate and tempered than the "mainstream" Western view on China.
1288034461943083008 2020-07-28 08:52:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @PAstynome I'm comfortable calling myself fluent in Chinese, but of course I know I can express myself with more nuance and sophistication in English. A person who can understand English will always get a better understanding of me and my world by listening to me in English. Vice versa true
1288034123945189378 2020-07-28 08:50:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @PAstynome It goes back to the language. If you speak rudimentary, superficial Chinese, you're always going to have rudimentary, superficial conversations.   And even if they speak English, you're going to get a more nuanced understanding of a person by hearing them in their native language

1287988742184030212 2020-07-28 05:50:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ruima @PAstynome Yeah, over the years it's dozens of small and large conversations with everyone from friends to classmates to taxi drivers and ayis.  It's not a concerted anthropological effort like a researcher...you slowly absorb nuances and adjust your perspective organically over time.

Anyone who's met a few dudes from Dongbei who have "Han" on their ID card and then met guys from Hainan who also have "Han" on their ID card would be pretty confused.
1287815358590537728 2020-07-27 18:21:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @JoshuaYJackson I've been thinking about this recently. I get quite dejected about "the state of things" after spending an afternoon on Twitter, then I get out into the "real world" and realize that almost no one is paying attention and everyone's life is just kind of going along.

1287622498465406976 2020-07-27 05:35:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orvilleschell No offense meant specifically to you, but the standard for being qualified to comment on China is much higher these days.  If you had true Chinese fluency and more modern in-country experience, you'd know that talking about Â§©ÂëΩ to describe China today is totally garbage.
1287622460590809089 2020-07-27 05:34:52 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orvilleschell For 30+ years now, the first laowai who made their way to China after reform and opening up have been lauded as China experts in the West and empowered with platforms to serve as "China whisperers" to a Western audience.
1287622366881705986 2020-07-27 05:34:29 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orvilleschell Obsessions with these phrases is typical of orientalism. If you aren't sure that what you're saying is falling into some mystique fallacy or not, just try imagining that you were using this logic to describe a phenomenon in France, or Germany or Australia.
1287621571394166786 2020-07-27 05:31:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @orvilleschell So you're getting screamed at on Twitter. Let me try to explain  "Mandate of Heaven" is NOT a relevant phrase to understand modern Chinese politics or society. Leaning heavily into 'exotic' culture phrases like this (see also: Èù¢Â≠ê, ÂÖ≥Á≥ªÔºå Â§©‰∏ã etc) is lazy and arrogant Sinology.
1287609047558971393 2020-07-27 04:41:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @darrenlonghk @Kongduino We pay almost 10 HKD less for a Kowloon Dairy "liter" of milk in Shenzhen.  The vegetables on this list look mostly comparable in price to a SZ grocery. The dairy and meat is all more expensive.  It just so happens to be grocery day...I'll take some notes at the Carrefour.
1287608025906216961 2020-07-27 04:37:30 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @darrenlonghk @Kongduino Interesting read. It does indeed seem to be a grocery pricing 'bubble'.  But unless it could be shown that HK grocers are enjoying much higher margins than those of other countries, are they really the right place to point the finger? Or are uncontrolled rents to blame?
1287598146646810625 2020-07-27 03:58:15 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @darrenlonghk @Kongduino Well, sure, of course. But perhaps the grocery consumption habits of those living on the island and a pretty small chunk of Kowloon are somewhat different from the rest of the city?

1287584638165086209 2020-07-27 03:04:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Kongduino @darrenlonghk I've always hated these attempts to do a "standard basket of groceries" comparisons across countries and cultures. Yes it's useful for a expat who wants to buy the exact same basket of expat groceries in different countries. How many HK locals are buying that basket though?

It's an awful clip and the guy should be identified and dealt with, harshly. If there's no proof that it's related to politics, then it shouldn't be treated as a political clip.

It turns out the Chinese economic model doesn't suck when it's overseen by actual technocrats, instead of former farmers and soldiers, and when the option to engage in international trade exists.

Western liberal democracy is not the gold standard for all.

SO while the usage may be accurate, it IS a good example of loaded/negative phrasing that indicates entrenched biases - Western media loves to use these.

The narrative many people for granted on China is often more a product of political and media distortion than reality, and the 'experts' have no relevant credentials.

That's a true perspective, but only applies to you.  It would be impossible for you or me  to experience the USA as a poor minority, for example. Same for XJ..

Just one TINY example of emotionally loaded and biased reporting/video production. I want to see more media access to Xinjiang as well, but I get their caution...
1286526089980833794 2020-07-24 04:58:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @qianjinghua For instance, the Vice News documentary from a few years ago, when they show footage of kindergartens in Hotan where children of detained Uyghurs now live as boarding students.

Western media and politicians think it's coming from a bonfire.   More sober examination would suggest more like a campfire, or smaller.   Disingenuous to take the position of "there is no fire" in my opinion.

The clumsy attempts at grassroots PR are based on a model that would potentially work for a Chinese audience, who buy into "model minorities" singing and dancing.

You're trying to understand China in terms of Western political culture, which is not useful or appropriate.   You can't generalize sociocultural values in this way.

Not much of all kinds of worship really, until they visit a Buddhist temple. Then everyone's a Buddhist. But they're only praying for riches and fertility.  ;)
1283983057276395525 2020-07-17 04:33:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joan_poh @ozoh11 Fun fact: I originally chose the surname È±º (similar to EN surname). Everyone laughed at me, so I eventually adopted ‰Ωô instead. But È±º is in fact a real (if very uncommon!) surname. I knew a girl surnamed È±º in college. If I could go back, I would actually persist in keeping È±º.

Your sense of family clan identity as a Malaysian Chinese may have diverged somewhat from what is 'acceptable' in modern PRCÔºü
1283981170120683522 2020-07-17 04:25:40 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joan_poh @ozoh11 Well to be frank, I feel you have what would be considered a fairly non-mainstream take, at least for modern Mainland China, while is very interested in having foreigners study Chinese and takes no small amount of delight in us having Chinese names (including surnames).
1283978730512117761 2020-07-17 04:15:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaBazzar @ShawSabrina @SamHarrisOrg So I trust MBFC to tell me if a website has a history of printing things that I would find to be conspiracy theory. But maybe others would disagree.   For instance, climate change denial is a conspiracy theory for liberals, generally, but not for many conservatives.
1283978082353725447 2020-07-17 04:13:24 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaBazzar @ShawSabrina @SamHarrisOrg Well the idea of what is or isn't a conspiracy theory is of course political.  If a website promotes flat-earthism, you can get partisan agreement on whether it's a conspiracy theory, but not for climate change.   My personal bias for conspiracy theorism is liberal (as is MBFC).
1283977319166603264 2020-07-17 04:10:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @2vetements @hyejuche Why do you keep repeating lies? Are you invested in the military industrial complex? What other reason could you have for disregarding all evidence and proof against these blatant and obvious falsehoods.

You're literally saying "I already believe what I believe and so I don't need to listen to anything that goes against what I believe".   You would be a great target for religion.
1283974782107570177 2020-07-17 04:00:17 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @joan_poh @ozoh11 Honest question: You don't think Westerners should take Chinese surnames when we study Chinese and live in China? I've never heard someone take issue with it before.  I don't have my Chinese name on my profile, but I do identify with it. It helps for people that don't speak EN.
1283973592951087105 2020-07-17 03:55:34 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ChinaBazzar @ShawSabrina @SamHarrisOrg Yeah I know MBFC is pretty much just a guy, but it's good for confirming conspiracy theory/pseudoscience.   I consider Allsides to be the gold standard for bias analysis. But they don't cover nearly as many publications as MBFC.   Here's WND on AllsidesÔºö   https://t.co/XIynYexRvn

Why aren't "China watchers" accusing China of atrocities able to explain what  benefit of those atrocities? They condescend China too much to even assume logical motivations.
1283222026539261953 2020-07-15 02:09:06 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @shaunrein Western media and politicians view the Party with the complexity that a bad scriptwriter treats an underwritten villain.   "He doesn't NEED a reason to do evil things. He's just evil".   In the real world, actions must come from motivations. Even evil actions like genocide.

What is the benefit to 'diluting' or 'ethnic cleansing' the Uyghurs?  If that's the objective, why would they be excluded from the one child policy for decades, causing their population to double?

1281799828184301568 2020-07-11 03:57:48 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim Think you typo'ed. "A real Hui", not a "real Muslim"  I agree that the logic of a "secular Hui" is not a "real Hui" is strange, but from perspective of Han Chinese kind of makes sense.  The defining feature of "being Hui" in eyes of Han Chinese is usually being a Muslim, right?
1281781305647104001 2020-07-11 02:44:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @danharris Dan, you should take a few steps back and examine your tweets...you've put yourself in an echo chamber where you say ignorant and hateful things and then go on to surround yourself with people who agree with you.

Different provinces have different plans for gas, but it's generally minimal due to cost, only used for peaking.
1280011182783385600 2020-07-06 05:30:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 11/FINISH It will happen. China likes blue skies as much as the next country. But it will not be accelerated in a way that the power grid, policy structure, or the economy are unprepared to handle. It will happen exactly at the pace appropriate for China.
1280010136963219457 2020-07-06 05:26:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 10/? The future of China's power sector is going to be a gradual de-emphasis on coal in favor of renewables, some gas, and some nuclear. This will need to be supported by robust power trading schemes, improved regional inter-connectivity, and more technical innovation for RE.
1280009542001025024 2020-07-06 05:23:50 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 9/? Regulation-based approach to sort out China's power sector is like fixing code. You address one bug but something breaks somewhere else. Too much coal led to pollution which led to solar subsidies which led to too much solar which led to curtailment which led to...
1280008644138950662 2020-07-06 05:20:16 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 8/? But because of the huge glut of renewables in the system, that have priority of dispatch, actual coal operating hours are about 4700 hours annually or lower, with their compensation/MWh at a fixed rate. This is very difficult for coal generation cashflow.
1280008106211041284 2020-07-06 05:18:08 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 7/? This takes us to pricing. Coal plants in China have bad finances because their operating hours are low, not because they are not economically viable. Their offtake price from the grid is fixed by the NDRC at an assumed level of about 5600 operating hours annually
1280007647702298625 2020-07-06 05:16:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 6/? Solar and wind has even been curtailed badly in recent years in Western and NE China, because they generated more than the grid needed and they had nowhere to send it. Curtailment is a big concern for would-be RE project developers in China. It's improved in recent years.
1280007159858655232 2020-07-06 05:14:22 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 5/? And yeah, there's tons of wind and solar resources, but it's concentrated in the NE, NW, North, all low load centers. You gotta build ultra-high voltage lines to get it to the load centers in eastern China or find a way to stimulate local consumption.
1280006665555734528 2020-07-06 05:12:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 4/? After all, the power sector is indeed oversupplied, but if all newbuild was frozen (let's just say theoretically), China's power demand growth would "eat up" that oversupply in just about 2 years, while a coal plant takes longer than that to build.
1280006058862186496 2020-07-06 05:10:00 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 3/? It's true that China can want to build more coal and also eliminate excess capacity at the same time. We're talking supercritical plants at 1000 MW range using the most modern tech, while phasing out the oldest, dirtiest coal (300 MW and smaller, conventional plants).
1280005517587312640 2020-07-06 05:07:51 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 2/? Provincial party leaders hold some power on new plant approvals, but certainly less than they did back in 2014-2016, when the reins were fully loosened and hundreds of GWs were approved in 2 years. Much of it was postponed or canceled later.
1280004959992455168 2020-07-06 05:05:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nathanking @ftchina 1/? New coal plant approvals have indeed picked up, part of the post-COVID Êñ∞Âü∫Âª∫ New Infrastructure plan, which also includes other energy projects, EV charging stations, smart grids etc...this is a nation-wide energy plan, not just focused on coal plants for a quick fix
1280001687025881088 2020-07-06 04:52:38 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> Lest we forget, as we defend China from what is often unreasonable criticism...that sometimes such criticism is indeed warranted.

I'd invite you to cry me a river, but your tears ducts are probably dried up.   Don't bother breaking your hip on the way to the Reply button - I won't respond anyway.

It kinda sounds like he wants a one-party system, where only one political viewpoint is allowed?   Dude should come to China..he'd love it here. Authoritarianism seems right up his alley.

Not sure what you're arguing about...USG funding HK protesters isn't a much of a secret, so not really a debate...?   https://t.co/66yDe3ztPs

1279115486534361088 2020-07-03 18:11:11 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @fierce_now @martjacques @chenweihua Well that's because we ALREADY have, among others, the Espionage Act, the Patriot Act, and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2384 (seditious conspiracy).   You're welcome to argue that these laws overreach in the USA (many would agree), but it's utterly obtuse to claim that they don't exist.

1278930900072271872 2020-07-03 05:57:42 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jacob_T_Gunter @andymok Personally, I think you'd mostly see a mix of disinterested apathy and brutal moral pragmatism.  Look what a struggle it's been to get comfortable middle class suburbanites to pay attention to BLM in the USA...   These attitudes take whole generations to evolve.

Their demands of the government are generally limited to their immediate person and family: make it easy for me to keep my health and gather wealth.
1278927379067363328 2020-07-03 05:43:43 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jacob_T_Gunter @andymok Also, even if foreign media's claims about Xinjiang were being shared widely among Chinese citizens, do you think believe that would change the Chinese people's opinion of their government?
1278926734591537152 2020-07-03 05:41:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jacob_T_Gunter @andymok Jacob, we have quite similar backgrounds in China. Do you believe that Chinese people would be less satisfied with their government if they could read more foreign news?  Never mind the fact that young, educated Chinese people already do, (~15% of internet users use VPNs daily)
1278922179745181697 2020-07-03 05:23:03 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Paulbot21 @andymok Chinese people are legitimately pleased with their government. Your inability to understand even this simple truth is going to make it impossible for you to understand anything else about China.

Tibet requires a travel permit, for which you have to register with a tour group.  You can hop on a flight or train to most places in Xinjiang basically anytime. Photography is not banned.
1278904589635350528 2020-07-03 04:13:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim Twitter is so radicalized, it feels like you aren't allowed to have nuanced opinions anymore. You give your extremist  opponent one single concession and they seize on it, misquote you, and refuse to discuss anything honestly.
1278777866470092800 2020-07-02 19:49:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @_tanwho_ I think discourse on Twitter radicalizes people. Encountering people who have opposite opinions and hate you so vociferously and vehemently causes your own position to become more entrenched and increasingly extreme.

1278638094107828225 2020-07-02 10:34:12 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 When in reality the only places you see that are:  - Beijing around Tian'anmen Square - Xinjiang (apparently...I haven't been) - Shanghai city center on the weekends when they're trying to crack down on unlicensed mopeds...lol

Not clear on what 'Red China' looks like on the ground, but assuming it must have massive physical police presence in support of the authoritarian regime.
1278629683869831168 2020-07-02 10:00:47 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Jerry_grey2002 The security presence you describe for Xinjiang seems roughly about the same as what a first-time visitor to China from the West expects to see in EVERY Chinese city.  I know my parents were expecting heavy police presence on every street corner the first time they came.

I'd say there exists an "expert" for every conceivable viewpoint, and the media chooses who gets the spotlight.

1278564941893480448 2020-07-02 05:43:31 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @nytimes I suppose after 23 years of having full authority and ability to create their own national security law (as mandated by HK Basic Law) and NOT doing it, this speed (efficiency) must indeed be very intimidating.   You gotta ask...why didn't HKers pass their own NSL?

So why wasn't there one? Why didn't they pass their own national security legislation for 23 years?
1278384663912828928 2020-07-01 17:47:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> It's possible that police commit crimes of excessive force against innocent protesters...  AND  ...and also that some protesters are actually rioting extremists who commit violent crimes...  ...to both be true at the same time.   Neither should justify the other.

1278015089325387777 2020-06-30 17:18:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan Yeah that's true. I could have demanded that my employer at the time pay all my wages in RMB, instead of a RMB/USD split. I'm sure that would have made me really popular with my employer - there's nothing an employer loves more than paying more payroll taxes :)
1278011398161760256 2020-06-30 17:03:56 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan I mean I don't claim to know everything about Chinese visas, as it's not my area of specialty or anything, but I've carried my fair share of tourist, business, visit, work/residence permit, and student visas over the years, so I'm not oblivious either...
1278009633970372609 2020-06-30 16:56:55 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan I had five years on a B work visa in Shanghai before I moved down here. I was still a few points short of qualifying for an A visa, despite my MA from a Chinese university, because most of my wages were paid off the books.   Not sure what point you're proving?
1278003351364317184 2020-06-30 16:31:57 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan Well I know a few things...my 60 day extension ran out last month and I had to fight hard for a brand new 60-day M visa (not 30) which I intend to extend again next month.   It helps that I work for a HK company handling Mainland business, so invite letters are easy.
1278001432537399296 2020-06-30 16:24:20 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @kevincarrico I think you might need to re-check the dictionary definition of the word "colonization"...
1277998571023790080 2020-06-30 16:12:58 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan As long as you can secure the invite letter, I expect you'll be good, although they might annoyingly try to give you the 30 day, which will basically be half used-up by the time it's actually issued. But at least you can apply for an extension again on that one...
1277975031524425739 2020-06-30 14:39:25 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan Hmmm well if the spousal visa route is no good, have you looked to see if you have a good rationale to apply for a temporary stay permit on humanitarian grounds? ‰∫∫ÈÅì‰∏ª‰πâÂ±ÖÁïôËØÅ There is a pandemic going on after all, and you've got family here.

1277970582768717829 2020-06-30 14:21:45 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan Yeah it's not a system very well-equipped to deal with unique cases. Either you fit as the correct peg into the mainstream workflows and career development paths, or you're stuck because no one ever thought to account for a case like you.

Perhaps my Beida classmates were considered high-value potential members. Nearly all of them said they had been proactively recruited at one point or another.
1277963404003561473 2020-06-30 13:53:13 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @ScotsAlan @AlistairsWorld In our own circles, we talk with great passion about how we would like to see China improved, and what we think CCP could do better.

They usually do apply, not because they have any strong political feelings, but because they have a understanding that it'll help them in life and career.
1277958720484372482 2020-06-30 13:34:36 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @steelmuslim Anyway I'd be impressed to hear your bogan Aussie English...probably the same as how Chinese feel when they hear my obviously Beijing-accented Mandarin...the nonstandard dialect coming from an unexpected face just makes it more interesting somehow.

No?

If you see one like this,  it's best to ignore or block it directly.
1277796747188695045 2020-06-30 02:50:59 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> But how is this possible? People telling me that China is refusing to allow independent investigators into China. I guess now they'll say it doesn't matter since China owns WHO or something.    https://t.co/n9IiunEaoy

Some of them have been there for 20 years and never crossed the border, and pretty much believe whatever their HK friends and colleagues have said.

You don't get into student loan debt because you had poor financial management skills...you get student loan debt because you were tricked as a teenager into taking education loans you couldn't afford to repay

Because they have poor financial management skills in general, and overspend on their credit cards.

Chinese have their 30+ year mortgage to pay off, but besides that I can't say I know of Chinese families worried about debt increasing..because they don't usually go into debt for other things (obviously exceptions exist..)

The average American household has these debts, and in addition, student loan debt and tons of consumer credit card debt.

In the DSM it's called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). I have no worries trusting a China analyst who doesn't know niche psych terms. A doctor on the other hand...üòâ

1276352742559084544 2020-06-26 03:13:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant Likely because there are far more Chinese living abroad than there are non-Chinese living in China. Also, you can express Chinese characters in pinyin that uses Latin alphabet, so Èôà can become Chen, but you can't express Western surnames in Chinese (except phonetically).
1276351772273983488 2020-06-26 03:09:10 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @Hubei_Peasant I think it's because of cultural convention. It's perfectly normal-sounding to have a non-Chinese given + Chinese surname (e.g. Susan Chen) but it sounds a bit strange to have a Chinese name + non-Chinese surname (e.g. Dewei Smith).

Please check the link I just sent. Every single survey, study, and research project in that table of presidential rankings cites the original source. Please don't be difficult for the sake of argument.

Obama consistently ranks in the 2nd quartile of all presidents according to (the opinions of) presidential scholars and historians. Like I said, above average, but not "the greatest ever".

What about debt deferment for private citizens, payroll tax abrogation for employers, or free healthcare for treatment associated with COVID19? Why do you feel the need to make things up? The truth doesn't match the narrative you wish to be true, I know that sucks.

1275450761808277505 2020-06-23 15:28:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Yeah, in early 2011. I found the gardens and landscaping around the sculpture more interesting than the sculpture itself, probably because of the masses of people inching their way up the side of cliff making it loud and somewhat unsafe in my view...
1275437425842548737 2020-06-23 14:35:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Yep definitely. There's some weird administrative region math going on there. Nanchang is the provincial capital and should be the largest city in Jiangxi, and it's got something like 5M+  To be fair, if we calc'ed the same in the US, all of NJ and CT would be New York City.
1275435195458441219 2020-06-23 14:27:01 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @przidnt1 Its Baidu page actually says it's up to 9.8 million now.   I question how the area is being calculated though. There are plenty of cities with 1-3 million in China that I haven't heard of, but we're talking about a city the size of Hangzhou now...can't hide those so easily.
1275429574680051712 2020-06-23 14:04:41 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @crakkkawooood @rosearathian Perhaps you'd find the YouTube channel 'The Black Experience Japan' interesting. It tells very compelling stories of black people from around the world (especially the West) who have relocated to East Asia and experienced a truly different world.    https://t.co/0SnxCqVIqr

They save for the car, then the house, then child-rearing and education, then elder care, it's a lifetime of expensive milestones. Plus rainy day funds...

If you can't see the difference, you're as blind as the alt-right and as equally ideologically screwed up as well. Think about that for a second. You're now comparable to the alt-right.

Worry about electronic voting machines, since they're so easily broken into and hacked. Oh wait, it seems that the fraud tends to benefit the GOP most of the time, so I suppose you don't care.    https://t.co/kLM4z7FMuH

Matt Johnson knows that voter fraud is out there...why can't they seem to find it?

It's just a word you say in an attempt to sound educated, but your misuse of it betrays your ignorance.   P.S. Here's a Fox News story about how rare voter fraud is.    https://t.co/kaw7oF0ppw

Considering the insanely bad track record electronic voting machines have and the fact that they're all made by companies with long histories of GOP donations...I'd be scared to use them.
1275109835596427264 2020-06-22 16:54:09 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @mdjohnson9 @SenGillibrand Nonsense. Every major investigation into voter fraud in the last two decades by bipartisan research bodies has turned up minuscule evidence of voter fraud. Preventing mail-in voting is vote suppression. You're a barefaced liar, also unacceptable in a civilized society.
1274753920754016256 2020-06-21 17:19:53 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> How is it possible that US news and media personalities still don't know how to pronounce "Xi" of Xi Jinping?   Please...Xi = "She" (with a rising tone, if you want extra credit)  Not Zheee. Not Ghjee. Not Zee. Just SHE.

1273460006550032384 2020-06-18 03:38:19 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @InitialVW The irony of talking about Chinese violence against minority groups in the context of massive protests against unending police brutality against minority groups in the USA.

The problem is that the student thinks a certain gender is genetically predisposed to be a better leader. Also the fact that you agree. is cringe.

1271293555349221376 2020-06-12 04:09:37 +0000 <pretentiouswhat> @AlyseWhitney And? It sounds like you weren't supposed to be doing what you were doing. You got a polite but clearly-worded email asking you stop and you've handled it super poorly, #1 by internalizing it emotionally and #2 by sharing it on Twitter 3#. Non-story.

Instead of pretending that they are unbiased, they divide the media platforms into left-learning, centrist, and right-learning, and then find you the same story from all three perspectives, so you can evaluate it for yourself.
